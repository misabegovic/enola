// Instructions is the guidance written into every target. It is deliberately short:
// agent instruction files are loaded into context on every session, so every line costs
// the user tokens forever, and the platform's own guidance is that shorter files produce
// better adherence.
//
// It tells the agent only what the agent still has to decide. The verification half of
// the loop is not described as a thing to remember, because with hooks installed it
// happens on its own, and an instruction that duplicates a mechanism is one more thing to
// drift out of date.
const Instructions = `## enola — architecture before and after a change

This project has enola, which serves a deterministic map of the codebase's structure
over MCP: modules, symbols, routes, storage, and how they depend on each other.

Before changing code whose blast radius is not obvious:

- ` + "`impact_analysis`" + ` — what transitively depends on this, before you touch it.
- ` + "`explore`" + ` / ` + "`traverse`" + ` / ` + "`find_path`" + ` — how something is wired, instead of
  reconstructing it by reading files.
- ` + "`set_baseline`" + ` — pin the architecture BEFORE you start editing, so the change can
  be graded afterwards. Do this once, early.

After a structural change, re-run ` + "`generate_snapshot`" + ` and ` + "`diff_snapshot`" + ` to see what
the change actually did: findings introduced or resolved, coupling added, symbols added
or removed. A dependency cycle or unintended coupling is a reason to fix the change
before presenting it, not something to mention afterwards.

Prefer these over re-deriving structure by grepping. They are exact, and they cost a
fraction of the file reading they replace.`

// HooksNote is appended when hooks are installed, so the file explains a mechanism the
// user will otherwise encounter with no idea where it came from — an unexplained message
// at the end of a session is exactly how a tool earns a reputation for being noisy.
const HooksNote = `

enola's hook is installed for this project: at the end of a session it reports the
architectural delta if — and only if — the change introduced a structural regression.
It never blocks, and it stays silent when the change is clean.

It speaks in one other case: when it could not grade the change at all, because the
baseline is not comparable to the current snapshot. That is NOT a verdict about your
change — it means no verdict was reached — and the remedy is to re-pin the baseline.
Said once per cause, not once per session.`
