// A hook registered in the wrong shape is a config that parses cleanly, reports
// success, and never runs. `Stop` was written as a flat list of entries for exactly
// that reason — a confident comment said the two events differed, a unit test
// asserted the shape it already believed in, and nothing ever checked whether the
// agent triggered it. It did not.
//
// So these tests assert mechanics — grouping as an invariant across ALL events,
// idempotency, migration, clean uninstall — and deliberately do not try to prove
// the shape is the RIGHT one. A unit test cannot: it can only compare the output
// against the same belief that produced it. That job belongs to the end-to-end test
// in hooks_e2e_test.go, which ends a real session and looks for the verdict.
