// MemWatch samples the heap for the lifetime of a run and reports the PEAK, which
// is the number that decides whether enola fits on a machine.
//
// It exists because the resident cost of a loaded graph and the cost of producing
// it are different by a factor of five to eight (measured: a 1.89M-fact kernel
// snapshot settles at 854 MiB and peaks at 6,524 MiB), and every instrument that
// was reachable before this one reported the wrong half:
//
//   - the engine's own end-of-snapshot log line runs after FreeOSMemory, so it
//     reports the survivor, never the peak;
//   - `ps rss` and macOS footprint report neither, because Darwin's
//     MADV_FREE_REUSABLE keeps freed pages resident — a kernel snapshot has shown
//     12.9 GB RSS against a 1.2 GB live heap;
//   - runtime.MemStats has no peak field, only instantaneous values.
//
// So the peak has to be sampled. The sampler ticks rather than hooking the GC
// because the peak regularly falls BETWEEN collections: two thirds of it is
// allocation churn the collector has not swept yet, which is exactly what a
// GC-triggered hook would miss.
//
// It is a development instrument, wired to hidden flags. Nothing in the product
// path reads it, and it writes to stderr rather than into any artifact — memory
// figures are not reproducible, and receipt.json is.

// Sampling rate. ReadMemStats stops the world, so this trades resolution against
// perturbing the thing it measures.
//
// The rate is adaptive because one interval cannot serve both ends of the corpus.
// At 150ms a two-minute kernel snapshot pays about 800 pauses — under 0.1% of its
// wall clock — while still resolving the seconds-long spikes that set its peak. But
// eShop finishes in 374ms, which is TWO samples, and a peak seen twice is not a
// peak, it is a coincidence: the first measured run reported 7 MiB for a repo whose
// real peak nobody knows. So the first two seconds are sampled at 10ms, which costs
// at most 200 extra reads and is invisible on any run long enough to care about.

//
// Writing the profile on each new high-water mark rather than once at the end is
// what makes the composition of the PEAK readable. Note that the profile's totals

// swept live objects and the peak is mostly unswept garbage; that difference is a
