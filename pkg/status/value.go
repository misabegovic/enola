// The value model estimates what enola saved you, in two currencies: tokens and
// time. It answers one question — *what would an agent have had to ingest to
// reach the same answer using ordinary tools (grep, glob, open a file, read it,
// infer)?* — and prices that counterfactual, not the size of enola's own
// response. See ARCHITECTURE.md, "The value model", for the full rationale.
//
// Two consequences of that framing drive the whole design:
//
//  1. Snapshot value scales with the CORPUS, not with the call. Reconstructing a
//     33M-token monorepo graph and a 72K-token service graph are not the same act
//     of work, and no flat per-call price can be right for both — the two are
//     more than two orders of magnitude apart.
//
//  2. Savings are accumulated AT CALL TIME, not recomputed from call counts at
//     render time. Corpus size, changed-file fraction and response size are only
//     known when the call happens. Persisting the resulting token figure — rather
//     than a weight to be re-applied later — also means every binary reports the
//     same number for the same usage file, instead of a build that has never heard
//     of a tool pricing it at defaultWeight.

	// no agent exhibits.
