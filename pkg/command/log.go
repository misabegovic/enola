// — which is what makes it safe to run against a checkout you do not own, and what keeps
// it honest about the one thing it reports: what enola has actually observed. A `log`
// that quietly took a snapshot to fill in a gap would be inventing the history it claims
// to be reading.
//
// EXPERIMENTAL. Recording is on by default (see config.HistoryConfig for why a feature
// like this cannot usefully be opt-in), so the common outcome on a repository enola has
// snapshotted before is a timeline, and on one it has not is a line saying to snapshot it.
