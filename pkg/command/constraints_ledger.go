// ConstraintsLedger is `enola constraints ledger [--json] [repo_path]`: how
// much of the declared law is being excused rather than obeyed.
//
// The gate has always collected the inputs — a suppression entry and an
// `exempt:` carve-out each name an owner, a reason and a date — and never
// asked the question they answer. A per-run verdict reports each excuse in
// isolation, which is exactly the view in which a rule that everybody signs
// away looks like thirty separate reasonable decisions.
//
// Read from the SNAPSHOT's own intent facts rather than from the working
// tree's YAML, deliberately: the rules counted here are the rules that
// produced the findings being counted beside them, so the two halves of every
// ratio come from one state of the law. A rule edited since the snapshot is
// therefore absent, and the report prints the snapshot's age so a reader can
// tell.
//
// A report, never a gate: exit 0 whenever a report was produced, 2 when it
// could not run. Nothing here changes what `enola check` fails on — a gate
// that failed on its own unpopularity is one nobody would leave enabled.
