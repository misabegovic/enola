// A fact's repo label comes from the base name of the directory the engine walked. Extract
// into the scratch directory itself and every revision is labelled with a different random
// name, so no two consecutive commits share a single fact: every patch is a full rewrite,
// every revision gets its own segment, and retention throws most of them away. The timeline
// still LOOKS like a timeline — it reported "+2509/-2457 facts" for days that touched a
// handful of files — which is what makes it worth a test rather than a comment.
