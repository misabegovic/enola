// Backfill is `enola log --backfill`: build the timeline that would have existed if enola
// had been running all along.
//
// Without it the feature is worth nothing on the day somebody wants it. A history answers
// questions about the past, and the first time anyone asks one — "when did this coupling
// appear?" — the honest answer from a fresh install is "I started watching on Tuesday".
// Backfill is what makes `enola log` say something about a repository the moment it is
// pointed at one.
//
// It reads the repository and writes NOTHING into it. Each commit's tree is extracted with
// `git archive` into a temporary directory and snapshotted there, so a checkout that is
// read-only, shared, or somebody else's is a valid target. `git worktree` would have been
// the obvious mechanism and was rejected for exactly that: it records bookkeeping under
// .git/worktrees, which is a write.
