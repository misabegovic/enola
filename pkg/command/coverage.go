// runCoverage is `enola coverage`: which cross-repo edges enola resolved, and which it
// did not.
//
// It exists because the report was previously reachable only through an MCP tool call —
// so an agent could ask, and the person deciding whether to trust enola's cross-repo
// linking could not. Cross-repo resolution is the claim hardest to verify from outside,
// and the only convincing way to settle it is to let someone run it against code they
// already know.
//
// A report, not a gate: it exits 0 whenever it ran. `enola check` owns the meaning of a
// non-zero exit — "your change did something" — and blurring that here would cost more
// than a threshold flag is worth.
