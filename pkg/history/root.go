// Root returns the directory holding a repository's architecture history.
//
// The default is OUTSIDE the repository — ~/.enola/graphs/<key>/history — for three
// reasons, each of which is a case repo-local storage gets wrong:
//
//   - enola can be pointed at a repository it has no business writing to. Reading the
//     architecture of a checkout you do not own is a normal thing to do, and `enola log`
//     on it must not create files in it.
//   - History outlives `.enola`. Clearing the output directory is routine (it is
//     derivable, that is the whole point) and must not silently delete the one thing
//     that is not.
//   - It matches where the graph receipt already lives, so everything enola keeps per
//     workspace keeps sitting together.
//
// override is config `history.dir`, for the case where a team WANTS the history inside
// the repository — to commit it, or to publish it from CI as an artifact. A relative
// override resolves against the repository, an absolute one is taken as given.
//
// A repo-local override lands under a path the walker must ignore. `.enola/history` is
// covered by the derived `<output.dir>/**` glob; a location outside the output directory
// needs its own ignore entry, or enola indexes its own history as source.

// workspaceKey derives a stable, human-readable directory name for a workspace from its
// absolute path: the sanitized base name plus a short hash of the full path, so two
// repositories sharing a base name do not collide.
//
// This mirrors the scheme internal/engine uses for ~/.enola/graphs/<key>.json (and
// pkg/status for its usage files) so a workspace's history sits beside its receipt under
// one recognizable name. It is deliberately a separate implementation rather than a
// shared one: this package must import nothing but pkg/facts and the standard library
// (see the package doc), and the engine's copy exists so the engine depends on nothing
// outside itself. The two agreeing is cosmetic — they name different files, and a
// divergence would be untidy rather than wrong.
