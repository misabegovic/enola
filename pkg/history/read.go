// Those are the same thing until a BACKFILL, which appends revisions for old commits after
// revisions for new ones — so a log read as written would show last month's architecture
// below this morning's. Every surface that presents a TIMELINE (log, blame, the MCP tools)
// sorts; nothing that WRITES does.
//
// That split is deliberate and load-bearing. Blobs chain in append order, so the writer
// asks "what did I store last" and must get the answer in append order: sorting inside Read
// would make a backfilled revision chain off the newest graph instead of its own
// predecessor, turning every patch into a near-complete rewrite and every revision into its
// own segment.
//
// Compared as INSTANTS, not as strings. RFC3339 only sorts lexically when every timestamp
// shares one UTC offset, and a history that mixes live and backfilled revisions never does:
// the recorder stamps UTC ("…Z"), while a backfill stamps each commit's own committer date
// with its author's offset. Seen on a Rust repository carrying +03:00 and +02:00, where the
// lexically-first revision (20:05:30+02:00 = 18:05 UTC) is forty minutes LATER than the real
// first (20:27:26+03:00 = 17:27 UTC) — enough to put the wrong revision at the start of the
// timeline, and from there to mislabel which one began the history.
//
// An unparseable timestamp keeps its string for comparison rather than being dropped or
// sorted to one end: it is still a revision, and guessing where it belongs is worse than
// placing it where its text says.
//
// Stable, so revisions sharing an instant keep the order they were recorded in — a second's
// resolution is coarse enough that an agent loop lands several in one.
