// Package history is the read side of enola's architecture history: the sequence of
// snapshots a repository has passed through, and what changed between them.
//
// enola has always held three snapshots and no timeline — the current one, the rotated
// `previous/`, and one pinned `baseline/`. That answers "what did my change just do?"
// and cannot answer "when did this coupling appear?". The history is an append-only log
// of revisions that makes the second question askable.
//
// # It is derived, never authoritative
//
// docs/SNAPSHOTS.md rests on a rule this package must not break: every file enola writes
// is derivable from the tree, and none of them accumulates a history the source has
// forgotten. A history is the first thing enola keeps that the working tree cannot
// reproduce on its own — so it is bounded by three properties:
//
//   - Every entry is REPLAYABLE. It records what a snapshot at that commit contained,
//     and re-running enola at that commit reproduces it. Nothing here is a measurement
//     that could not be taken again.
//   - Nothing that judges the PRESENT reads it. `check`, `diff_snapshot`, freshness and
//     drift keep reading only the current snapshot and the baseline. A verdict about the
//     tree as it is now must not depend on an accumulated file.
//   - Deleting it loses convenience, never truth.
//
// # It is local, and shaped so it need not stay local
//
// Nothing here talks to a network and nothing here requires an account. If a hosted
// history is ever offered it must be additive, which constrains the format now:
//
//   - Entries are keyed by repository IDENTITY (facts.RepoIdentity — the normalized git
//     remote), never by an absolute path, so two machines' histories of one repository
//     describe the same subject.
//   - Seq is machine-local bookkeeping. It is neither identity nor sort order: two
//     machines assign the same Seq to different revisions. Order by At plus git topology.
//   - The exchangeable unit is the entry plus its blob, addressed by ID. How a machine
//     PACKS blobs on disk is a local storage decision that never enters the format.
//
// Together those make two histories of one repository mergeable by union-and-dedup,
// which is the whole of the merge algorithm.
//
// # Boundary
//
// This package is READ-ONLY and imports only pkg/facts and the standard library. It must
// stay buildable with CGO_ENABLED=0: a viewer that reads a history has no business
// linking ten tree-sitter grammars, and importing pkg/bootstrap or pkg/dashboard (which
// do) turns a ~4 MB static binary into a ~39 MB cgo one. Writing lives in
// internal/history.
