// Blame answers the question a timeline exists for: WHEN did this appear, and when did it

// "When did internal/server start importing internal/extractors" is unanswerable from a
// snapshot, however good the snapshot is — it is a question about the past, and a snapshot
// has none. It is answerable here by scanning the stored patches, which is why the patches
// are verbatim canonical lines rather than a compact encoding: the search is a substring
// match over text.

// against the empty set, so every line in the graph appears as an addition in it. A scanner
// that read patches on their own would therefore report every symbol in the repository as
// "introduced" at each segment boundary, which on a long history is most of its answers.
// Comparing the matching subset of one reconstructed revision against the next asks the
// question that was actually asked: did this appear BETWEEN these two observations?
