// list has to name the right one. The single line this replaced asserted "Confidence <
// 1.00 is a candidate to verify" over every advisory list, including lists whose every
// entry printed `1.00` — a declared-layer violation or an intent set difference, both
// proven by construction and advisory only because their explainer is outside
// --fail-on. Telling a reader a 1.00 finding is uncertain is worse than saying nothing:
// the contradiction sits one line above the number that refutes it.
