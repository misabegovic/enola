// tempting default — but exactly measurable is not the same as universally unwanted.
// Go's own standard library is written in a language whose packages cannot form one and
// whose authors treat the restriction as a design constraint rather than a virtue; a
// Rails app assembles most of its graph at runtime and its community does not read a
// cycle between two app/ directories as a defect at all. Shipping a default that breaks
// those builds meant enola arrived asserting a position on someone else's architecture
// before it had measured anything, and the first thing a Go or Rails team had to learn
// was which flag turns the opinion off.
//
// So the gate now enforces only what the caller states: --fail-on names the explainers,
// --max-spillover bounds the scope check, and a run with neither reports its findings and
// exits 0. Nothing is hidden by that — an unenforced run says so in its own output rather
// than printing a green line that could be mistaken for an all-clear (see Render).
