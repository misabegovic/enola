// MinorThreshold is the commit share below which a contributor counts as MINOR to a
// module — someone who has touched it but does not know it.
//
// The 5% figure is Bird, Nagappan, Murphy, Gall & Devanbu, "Don't Touch My Code!
// Examining the Effects of Ownership on Software Quality" (ESEC/FSE 2011), where it was
// chosen by inspecting the ownership distribution of Windows Vista binaries — components
// averaging some 900 commits across 17 engineers.
//
// It is NOT validated here, and nothing in enola grades on it. On a three-person
// repository every contributor clears 5% and the split says nothing; on a large
// open-source tree almost nobody does. That is exactly why this number steers a reader
// toward a reviewer and never reaches a verdict's status. See AttachReviewers.

// ownedThreshold is the share the top contributor must hold before a module is
// described as having a clear owner. The paper reports `Ownership` as a continuous
// proportion rather than a cutoff; this is a presentation choice, used only to decide
// whether the routing line reads "owner: X" or "no single contributor above 50%".
const ownedThreshold = 0.50

// minModuleCommits is how many commits a module must have in the window before its
// shares are read as evidence of anything.
//
// Without a floor the arithmetic produces its most confident claims on its weakest
// data: a module with one commit in the window has a contributor holding 100% of it,
// and "you own this" is then said about a single drive-by edit. Measured on chatwoot,
// the top major-minor-dependency reported was a module with exactly one commit behind
// its 100%. The paper never had to draw this line — its components averaged some 900
// commits — and a repository of ordinary directories is nothing like that.
//
// Five is deliberately low. It is not a claim that five commits make an expert; it is
// the point below which a proportion stops describing a distribution at all.
