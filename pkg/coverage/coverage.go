// Package coverage reports which cross-repo edges enola resolved and which it did
// not, per service.
//
// It exists so the same answer reaches an agent and a person. The report was
// originally computed inside the MCP server, which meant only an agent could ask —
// and someone deciding whether to trust enola's cross-repo linking, the person who
// most needs it, had no way to see it. A command-line report must not have to import
// a stdio JSON-RPC server to reach its own data, so the logic lives here and both
// surfaces call it.
//
// The unresolved counts are the point of the report, not a footnote. Cross-repo
// linking is the claim hardest to verify from the outside, and a report that showed
// only what resolved would be advertising. Showing the misses is what makes the
// resolved number mean anything — and it is what tells a genuinely isolated service
// apart from one whose edges enola simply could not follow.
