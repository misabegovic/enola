// Package cli renders what an enola binary prints about itself: the `--list`
// tool catalogue and the `--help` text.
//
// It is a public package rather than internal/ because a wrapper binary (e.g.
// enola-enterprise) builds on the same surfaces: it lists its own license-gated
// tools alongside the engine's, and extends the shared help with sections that
// are meaningless here. Both extension points are data — ToolListSpec.Extra and
// HelpSpec's Commands/Flags/Sections — so nothing about a wrapper's features
// leaks into this package.
