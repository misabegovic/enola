# The dashboard

The dashboard displays snapshots produced by Enola's CLI and MCP tools. Use it to review
changes, follow dependencies, inspect snapshot metadata, and check extraction coverage.
It runs locally and reads existing snapshot data.

## Start here

Generate a snapshot, then start the dashboard:

```bash
enola --generate
enola dashboard --open
```

The dashboard stays attached to the terminal until Ctrl-C. Its startup message names
the snapshot directory and prints the complete local `http://` URL. Pass a repository
or multi-repository config path to select its snapshot:

```bash
enola dashboard --open ../service-a
enola dashboard --open cluster.yaml
```

The server binds to loopback (`127.0.0.1`). If Safari has HTTPS-Only mode enabled, allow
the local HTTP address or open the printed URL in another browser.

## Review a change

Pin a baseline before editing, then write a snapshot after the change:

```bash
enola baseline pin
# make the change
enola check --write
enola dashboard --open
```

Start on **Overview**. Change cards group new and resolved findings. Open a finding to
inspect its evidence in the Architecture tab. Findings describe the measured structure;
project policy determines which findings fail a check.

New and resolved categories require a comparable baseline. Without one, Overview shows
the current snapshot.

## Follow a dependency

Use **Architecture** to inspect:

- module consumers;
- module dependencies;
- source facts supporting an edge;
- highly connected modules;
- findings associated with the selected module.

Search covers every connected module, even when the overview renders only a smaller
set for clarity. Select a module to replace the overview with its immediate dependency
neighborhood. The graph, inspector, finding list, and module table share the current
selection. **Fit view** fits the visible graph in its viewport.

The labels distinguish total relationships from the subset currently drawn. A finding
such as “33 dependants” can refer to symbol-level evidence. A focused module graph shows
module-level neighbors. The inspector names the scope of the selected metric.

## Verify what the snapshot represents

**Snapshots** records when the graph was generated, the Git ref and working-tree state,
the extraction schema, contributing extractors, and analysis duration.

“Captured with local changes” means the snapshot includes the working tree at generation
time. Reproducing it requires the commit and those local changes.

The technical receipt contains the comparison inputs. Enola checks receipt compatibility
before computing a change: extractor and ignore-rule changes can alter the observed
graph.

## Check whether the analysis is complete

**Quality** accounts for indexed source, configured exclusions, unsupported or
non-source inputs, recognized files with zero facts, inactive extractors, parse failures,
and unresolved cross-repository connections.

The file-accounting row classifies every walked file. In the example, one TypeScript file
belonged to an inactive extractor, representing 0.1% of the 999 walked files.

The categories are:

- **Intentionally ignored** matched configured exclusions. Samples show which rules
  applied.
- **Non-source / unsupported** lists assets and file types outside the graph. The
  file-kind table identifies types that may carry architecture.
- **No facts emitted** contains recognized files with zero indexable facts.
- **Parse errors** contains extractor failures. The GitHub action opens an issue with
  snapshot details filled in.
- **Unresolved cross-repository connections** lists edges whose remote target was absent
  from the cluster snapshot.

## Understand sessions and usage

**Activity** shows active processes and lifetime totals. The highlighted row identifies
the process serving the page.

A dashboard-only process serves zero MCP tool calls. Snapshot generation performed by a
separate command appears in lifetime activity.

![Lifetime activity aggregated across completed and active sessions](images/DashboardLifetimeActivity.png)

Lifetime activity aggregates completed and active sessions across repositories. Enola
retains aggregate totals. Time and token savings estimate the repository reconstruction
avoided by using snapshot data.

## Refresh data

After generating or writing a newer snapshot, choose **Refresh data**. The dashboard
refreshes on request.

Refresh reloads the state available to the process serving that page. Use
`enola --status` in another terminal to find the URL for another workspace.

## Several dashboards at once

An MCP session can host the same dashboard, and several coding-agent sessions can run at
once. Each process has its own graph and ephemeral URL. `enola --status` lists the
running sessions and their dashboard URLs.

While any dashboard is running, Enola also tries to provide the bookmarkable shared URL
`http://127.0.0.1:7171`. The first process owns it; another can take over after that
process exits. The Activity page identifies the process serving the page.

## Related commands

Use the CLI to generate and compare snapshots. Declare architectural rules in
`enola-intent.yaml` and enforce selected finding classes with
`enola check --fail-on=...`.

confidence, see [EXPLAINERS.md](EXPLAINERS.md). For why Enola uses explicit snapshots,
