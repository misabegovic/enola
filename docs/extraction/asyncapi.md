# AsyncAPI — event contracts as architecture

AsyncAPI 2.x and 3.x YAML/JSON documents are detected by their top-level
`asyncapi` key. The extractor walks these formats directly because repository
configuration normally excludes YAML and JSON from the source walker.

Fixture: [`asyncapi_multirepo`](../../internal/engine/testdata/repos/asyncapi_multirepo/)

## At a glance

| You write | enola stores | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| a document with a top-level `asyncapi` key | walked directly, past the YAML/JSON ignore globs | — |
| 2.x `publish` / 3.x `send` | a topic with `messaging_role: producer` | `storage` |
| 2.x `subscribe` / 3.x `receive` | a topic with `messaging_role: consumer` | `storage` |
| a Kafka server protocol | `messaging: kafka` or `kafka-secure`, eligible for cross-repo Kafka linking | props |
| `operationId`, message name, content type, tags | carried on the topic, with `spec_file` and `asyncapi_version` | props |
| `orders/{orderId}` | the parameterized address, intact | `storage` |
| a local `$ref` to a channel, server, message or payload | resolved across YAML and JSON files, confined to the repository root | — |
| a Go or TypeScript Kafka call site on the same topic | an `implemented_by` edge and `messaging_implementation_status` | relation |
| a remote URL `$ref` | nothing — no document is ever fetched | — |

Each operation carries its operation ID, action, message name, content type,
summary, description, tags, specification path, and AsyncAPI version when those
values are present. Local channel, server, message, payload, property, and array
item `$ref` values are resolved across YAML/JSON files. Parameterized addresses
such as `orders/{orderId}` remain intact.

Referenced message payloads remain lightweight: the operation records their
resolved identity in `message_schema`, plus `schema_format` and `content_type`
when present. Enola deliberately does not emit schema fields as symbols or facts
until a compatibility or impact feature can consume them; this keeps schema-only
data out of symbol-based explainers and avoids snapshot noise.

These are messaging topics rather than HTTP routes, so they do not enter HTTP
matching or unused-route findings. Kafka consumer topics participate in Enola's
existing topic-owner linking convention, making asynchronous service dependencies
visible in traversal and impact analysis. Other protocols remain queryable contract
facts until a protocol-specific cross-repository signal is available.

`kafka-secure` remains recorded verbatim on the fact but is classified as Kafka
for linking; its suffix describes authentication or transport security rather
than a different messaging technology.

## Binding contracts to Kafka code

AsyncAPI and code extractors share one normalized messaging-operation contract:
`messaging`, `messaging_role`, and `messaging_operation`. AsyncAPI 3.x `send` and
`receive` normalize to `publish` and `subscribe`, matching the vocabulary emitted
from code call sites.

Go files importing a Kafka client package are scanned for conservative literal or
locally-resolved topic calls such as `Publish`, `Subscribe`, Sarama-style
`ConsumePartition`/`SendMessage`, and kafka-go `WriteMessages` with a `Topic`
field. TypeScript and JavaScript files recognize KafkaJS `send({ topic })` and
`subscribe({ topic })`, plus node-rdkafka-style `produce(topic, ...)`; static
`const` topic bindings are followed. Each call records its enclosing `code_symbol`.
A post-link binder joins an
exact topic+operation pair to a unique AsyncAPI operation in the same repository:

- The code fact gains `messaging_contract_bound`, the operation ID, and spec file.
- The contract gains `messaging_implementation_count`, `messaging_implemented_by`,
  and an `implemented_by` relation to the code symbol.
- Multiple matching contract operations are ambiguous and remain unbound — unless
  their extracted operation metadata and resolved payload schema are semantically
  equivalent. Equivalent bundled or generated copies count as one candidate; a
  non-canonical copy records `messaging_canonical_file`. Two files that disagree
  about the same channel, operation and protocol each gain
  `messaging_duplicate_of`, naming the conflicting file.

Protocol compatibility is part of that match. Kafka and `kafka-secure` are one
broker family, while an explicitly MQTT, AMQP, or WebSocket contract cannot bind
to a Kafka call site even if its channel name and direction are identical. A
missing contract protocol remains eligible for specifications with no server.

The Kafka-import gate is required: ordinary in-process event buses frequently use
methods named `Publish` and `Subscribe`, and treating those as broker operations
would manufacture contract coverage that does not exist.

## Messaging contract coverage

The `messaging-coverage` explainer turns binding verdicts into three actionable
findings, available through `query_insights(explainer="messaging-coverage")`:

- A static Go or TypeScript Kafka call with no matching AsyncAPI operation is an
  **undeclared messaging operation** (confidence 0.9).
- An AsyncAPI operation with no detected supported implementation is an
  **unimplemented contract candidate** (confidence 0.65).
- Two specs declaring the same channel, operation and protocol with different
  content is a **conflicting messaging contract** (confidence 0.9).

The second is intentionally a candidate rather than a dead-code verdict: an
implementation may use a wrapper, dynamic topic, unsupported client library, or
live outside the loaded snapshot. Code facts also record a stable binding status
(`bound`, `undeclared`, `ambiguous`, or `protocol_mismatch`) and compatible
candidate count, so an absent binding remains explainable through `query_facts`.

## What is deliberately not extracted

Remote URL `$ref` documents and broker-specific binding interpretation are not
expanded. Local references are confined to the repository root, and cycles or
missing targets are skipped without dropping the surrounding channel operation.
Schema-field extraction, compatibility, and impact verdicts remain a separate
capability and should ship together.
