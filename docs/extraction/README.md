# What enola extracts, per language

These pages answer one question: **given this code, what ends up in the graph?**

Every example is a file that ships in this repository, and every fact shown is copied
from the golden file the test suite asserts against. So none of it is a description of
intended behaviour — it is the behaviour, and if an extractor changes without these
pages changing, the golden tests fail first.

## How to read a page

Each one is organized the same way:

1. **At a glance** — a table from source construct to fact kind.
2. **What each construct produces** — the code, then the facts, then the query it unlocks.
3. **What is deliberately not extracted** — the limits, stated next to the capability.

That last section is not an apology. A missing edge shows up in `enola coverage` as an
unresolved count you can go and look at; a *wrong* edge is invisible and gets acted on.
Every extractor here reports the gap rather than inventing the edge, and the section
says where those gaps are.

## The fact model in one paragraph

Everything below is one of six kinds — `module`, `symbol`, `route`, `storage`,
`dependency`, `service` — plus two reference-only kinds (`file_ref`, `test_ref`) that
carry edges without being architecture themselves. Facts are name-keyed, carry a
`file:line`, and hold typed relations (`imports`, `calls`, `declares`, `handled_by`,
`depends_on`, …). [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md#the-fact-model) has the full
model; these pages assume it only loosely.

## If you are adding one

Two things are contracts rather than conventions, and both are enforced by tests.

**Register the `source` value of any route you emit.** A route's `source` prop says which
pass produced it, and the cross-repo linker branches on it. The values live in
[`internal/facts/contract.go`](../../internal/facts/contract.go); emit the constant, never
the literal. When you add one, decide whether it is a **hand-written call site** (a human
wrote this request — `ts-http-client`, `retrofit`, `urlsession`) or **contract-derived**
(read from a spec or IDL — `openapi`, `grpc-proto`). Hand-written sources belong in
`HandWrittenClientSources` and link as `via: "http-client"`; the rest link as `via: "http"`.

That choice is the whole difference between "someone wrote this call" and "a spec implies
this call", which is what a reader of the graph wants to know. It is enforced because it
was once wrong: the linker kept a private copy of the hand-written set that had never
included the Java extractor's two values, so every `RestTemplate` and `@FeignClient` call
site linked as generic `via: "http"` for as long as that extractor had existed. Nothing
failed, because nothing tied the reading side to the writing side.

**The `source` prop carries two unrelated vocabularies.** On a `route` fact it is
provenance (`ts-http-client`, `grpc-proto`, …). On a `dependency` fact it is where an
import *resolves to* (`internal` / `external` / `stdlib`). Reading it without checking
`Kind` first gets you a value from the wrong vocabulary. The overload is historical and not
worth a migration — renaming a prop key rewrites every golden and every saved snapshot —
but it is a real trap.

### Reading a file the globs exclude

Extractors receive the walked file list, which the `ignore` globs have already filtered.
That is right for source files and wrong for the handful of config-format files that carry
architectural meaning — an OpenAPI spec, Symfony's route YAML, `package.json`'s package
name, `tsconfig.json`'s path aliases. Those are read **directly from disk**, because the
globs exist to suppress config/data noise, not to hide files the graph depends on.

If you add such a read, walk from `repoPath` yourself and skip the excluded directories
explicitly — the globs no longer protect you, and `node_modules` is the one that matters:
a dependency's `package.json` read as if the repo published it is a fabricated cross-repo
edge.

This is not hypothetical. `package.json` was read from the filtered list, and the bundled
`mcp-arch.yaml` ignores `**/*.json`. Under it no `package_name` prop was emitted at all, so
the linker's own-`@scope` guard could not fire and a repo importing a sibling package it
publishes itself was reported as depending on another repo entirely. The golden fixtures
kept passing throughout, because they build their engine from `config.Default()`, which has
no such glob — the fixture and the shipped config had been disagreeing for as long as the
guard existed.

[docs/EXTENDING.md](../EXTENDING.md) covers the rest: binders, cross-repo signals, and the
`linking:` vocabulary.
