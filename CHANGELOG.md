# Changelog

Every released version, newest first: the headline it shipped under and, where one was
written, its summary. Dates are the GitHub release dates.

The full per-release change lists — every Added, Changed and Fixed line — are on
[enola.tech/changelog](https://enola.tech/changelog). This file is the same history at
the resolution a reader of the repository needs.

## v0.4.5 — 2026-08-23

**The verdict where CI reads it, provider facts cached, and detection that stops re-walking the tree**

Most of this release is the work of
[Muhamed Isabegović](https://github.com/misabegovic).

`enola check` has four writers over one verdict: `--format` picks text, json, sarif or
annotations, and nothing is recomputed for a writer. SARIF carries one rule per declared
rule id with the team's `because:` as its description, the evidence span as its region,
and a stable identity under `partialFingerprints`. Annotations place every positioned
finding on its file and line, as GitHub workflow commands or Buildkite markdown grouped
by file; findings with no position are counted at the end rather than placed somewhere
plausible. The host is a flag and never read from the environment, so a laptop renders
what CI rendered.

Every verdict now also says what it could not see. One `could not see:` line and a
census report what each provider contributed and where two of them overlapped, joined
per site. Two providers that spell the same receiver differently produce one edge rather
than two, with the surviving relation stamped `resolution_agreement`; receivers that
genuinely differ are both kept and counted by shape. `since` and `growth` read git blame
per witness file at author time, so a rebase does not restart the clock, and a breach
that cannot be dated names which of three things was unknown instead of defaulting to
now.

**Provider facts are cached.** A per-file provider keeps one entry per file keyed by
content; the built-in Rubydex provider keeps one whole-index entry keyed by its library
version, the Ruby file set and the lockfile. The receipt says how much was reused, so a
warm run that reuses nothing is visible rather than merely slow. On a Rails monolith of
roughly 1.7 million facts, providers were 249 seconds of a 292 second run before this.

**Language detection no longer re-walks the tree.** Every extractor used to answer
`Detect` with its own bounded walk, and every bound was a cliff a real repository falls
off — dotnet/runtime keeps all 3,270 of its C/C++ sources below the three levels the C++
detector scanned, so the extractor never ran at all. Detection is now membership over
the file list the engine already walked. Across a 20-repository polyglot corpus it
recovers 13,496 of the 13,828 files an extractor claimed and no extractor read.

`constraints explain` answers incoming edges as well as outgoing ones, and reports what
moving a file out of its part would cost: the verdicts that would appear and the ones
that would vanish. Rubydex emits one dependency per qualified read, carrying the file
that defines it, and every refusal carries a cause from a closed set.

Fixed: `constraints init` and `constraints explain` returned on success instead of
exiting, so the argument loop re-read `constraints` as an unknown command and exited `1`
after printing a correct report. Their exit codes are now documented beside `lint`'s.

Documentation: a [Rails workflow page](docs/RAILS.md), the declaration standard split
into [INTENT](docs/INTENT.md), [CONSTRAINTS](docs/CONSTRAINTS.md) and
[PROVIDERS](docs/PROVIDERS.md), an [index of the docs tree](docs/README.md), and this
changelog.

## v0.4.4 — 2026-08-23

**Laws written in Ruby, Angular, and the rule forms only a graph can state**

Constraints can be written as Ruby sentences, parsed and never executed, compiling to
the same declaration YAML produces. The rule vocabulary reaches 21 forms, including the
ones that need the whole graph — one owner per table, storage that stays home, a route
that must have a consumer, a file that must be governed by a page — plus `since` and
`growth` as a time dimension, and the smallest cut named beside every breach. Angular is
read the way the framework works: decorator-declared classes, dependency injection,
composed routes, templates, and requests through an injected `HttpClient`. Convention
recipes ship with the binary, so a repository binds `rails-conventions` in one command.
Rubydex joins Prism as a built-in Ruby fact provider.

## v0.4.3 — 2026-08-20

**Rails route parity, fewer query-loop false positives, and utoipa routes**

Rails route derivation matched Rails across a 3,500-route application. This release also adds dead-method detection and utoipa routes, improves query-loop analysis, and cuts a 22-repository cluster rerun from 891s to 224s.

## v0.4.2 — 2026-08-18

**Fact paths fixed on Windows; docs checked against the code**

A declared layer order could silently match zero modules on Windows. Every fact path is now forced to forward slashes regardless of host, and a new CI check catches documentation that has drifted from what the code actually does.

## v0.4.1 — 2026-08-18

**AsyncAPI channels and Kafka call sites, cross-service**

Messaging contracts declared in AsyncAPI now join the graph the same way HTTP routes do, so a missing consumer or an undeclared producer shows up as a finding instead of staying invisible.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-08-17

**Declared architectural law**

Architecture rules you write down are now verdicted against the measured graph, checked before an edit lands, and gateable in CI. Tools Enola does not ship can contribute facts through one seam, and the recorded history moves between machines.

## v0.3.21 — 2026-08-15

**Nothing fails until you name it**

The check gate no longer ships an opinion about which findings should break a build, and repository labels come from the Git remote so a second clone compares against its own baseline.

## v0.3.20 — 2026-08-14

**Express sub-router mounts compose across files**

A router declared in one file and mounted in another now reports its routes at the path they actually serve, which is the layout most Express services use.

## v0.3.19 — 2026-08-14

**Lower peak memory, and a verdict that says why nothing failed**

Cold-run peak heap drops by a quarter to two fifths on large repositories, and advisory findings now name the reason they did not fail the build.

## v0.3.18 — 2026-08-13

**Full Rails route tables, plus Grape**

Rails routes are now read from every routes file, not just the top-level one, and Grape APIs are detected automatically.

## v0.3.17 — 2026-08-12

**Five grammar updates and a protocol bump**

Java, Ruby, C, C++, and PHP move to newer tree-sitter grammars, the bundled MCP SDK updates to the latest protocol, and CI gets hermetic tests and pinned tool versions.

## v0.3.16 — 2026-08-11

**Vendored OpenAPI specs no longer read as your own server routes**

A mobile app vendoring the OpenAPI spec of a backend it calls was indexed as if it served those routes itself, manufacturing inbound edges and unused-route findings that don't exist.

## v0.3.15 — 2026-08-09

**The update-available notice actually gets written now**

The check for a newer enola release only ever ran from two entry points, so most installs never got the cache file it depends on. It now refreshes from any command.

## v0.3.14 — 2026-08-09

**Uninstall leaves nothing behind**

enola uninstall now removes the empty files and directories it leaves behind, instead of stripping its own configuration out and abandoning the shell.

## v0.3.13 — 2026-08-08

**Dart and Flutter extraction, gin routes, and update notices**

Enola now extracts Dart and Flutter apps — widgets, navigation, storage, and outbound calls — plus gin routes in Go, and tells you when a newer enola is available.

## v0.3.12 — 2026-08-08

**Scala extraction and native Codex hooks**

Enola now extracts Scala — call graph, routes, storage, and complexity metrics tuned for its effect-typed idioms — and enola install --hooks wires real session hooks for Codex.

## v0.3.11 — 2026-08-07

**Understand the architecture of an entire .NET solution**

Enola now reads every language in a .NET solution, not just C#, and understands how the pieces are wired together — project references, EF Core storage, outbound HTTP calls, and dependency injection.

## v0.3.10 — 2026-08-07

**C# extraction**

Enola now extracts C#: types and members, dependency injection, and both of ASP.NET Core's routing mechanisms.

## v0.3.9 — 2026-08-06

**Declared architectural intent, five new extraction kinds, and a lower memory footprint**

Repos and knowledge pages can now declare what the architecture is supposed to be, graded against every snapshot. Coverage extends to five new kinds, Ember support is complete, and large graphs use substantially less memory.

## v0.3.8 — 2026-08-04

**Ember and Glimmer extraction**

Enola now resolves routes, templates, services, and data-model relationships in Ember applications.

## v0.3.7 — 2026-08-04
