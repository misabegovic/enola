**enola indexes your repository into a dependency graph, pins that graph before a change, and exits `1` if the change left two modules importing each other** - a **dependency cycle**. Tree-sitter parsers and Tarjan's algorithm - no model, no embeddings, nothing leaves your machine.

Your agent reads the same graph over **MCP** - the protocol Claude Code, Cursor and Copilot use to plug in tools - so it knows what depends on what *before* it edits, and gets the verdict *after*, in time to fix its own regression.

Go · TypeScript/JavaScript · Python · Java · Kotlin · Scala · Swift · Ruby · Rust · C/C++ · .NET · PHP · Dart · Vue · Svelte · Ember · Terraform · Ansible · gRPC · OpenAPI · GraphQL - [full list](#supported-languages)

Your agent adds a helper, and `billing` and `invoice` now import each other. You run `enola check`:

```
FAIL - 1 structural regression introduced.

Regressions (fail):
  - [cycles] 1.00 - Cyclic dependency detected (2 modules)
      module "billing" is part of the cycle
```

Exit code `1`, so a commit hook or a CI job can stop there. The [full output](#what-the-verdict-tells-you) names every symbol and every edge the change added.

## Quickstart

**1. Install the binary.** No Go toolchain, no C compiler - Linux, macOS (amd64/arm64) and Windows:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enola-labs/enola/main/install.sh | sh
```

That drops one binary into `~/.local/bin`. If the next command comes back `enola: command not found`, that directory isn't on your `PATH` yet:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**2. Tell your agents it exists, and close the loop automatically:**

```bash
enola install --hooks
```

This writes enola's instructions into the files your agents already read - Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Pi - and `--hooks` adds the two hooks that grade each session for you. It previews every change and asks before writing, never creates a shared file like `AGENTS.md` that wasn't already there, and `enola uninstall` reverses everything byte-for-byte, including the files and directories it created itself.

**3. Give your agent the graph over MCP.** Pick your client:

| Client | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add enola enola` |
| **Copilot (VS Code)** | `code --add-mcp '{"name":"enola","command":"enola"}'` |
| **Cursor** | add the block below to `.cursor/mcp.json` (or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for every project) |
| **Codex, or any other MCP client** | add the same block to its MCP config |

<details>
<summary>MCP config block</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "enola": {
      "command": "enola"
    }
  }
}
```

Copilot's `.vscode/mcp.json` uses `servers` as the top-level key instead of `mcpServers`. A config path in `args` is optional everywhere - omit it to run on built-in defaults. Full details and per-client restart instructions: [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

</details>

**4. Confirm it actually works.** After your next session:

```bash
enola doctor
```

A report, not a gate - it always exits `0`. It is the fastest way to find out that something has gone quietly wrong:

- **whether the hooks fired.** A hook configuration is a contract with your agent, and one it silently ignores looks exactly like one it honours, so `doctor` reports when each hook last ran rather than whether it is configured.
- **whether your baseline still counts.** One pinned by a different enola version, or under different ignore rules, is not comparable - and nothing is graded against it until you re-pin.
- **whether there is a newer release** - and specifically whether the **extractors** changed, which means your snapshots are missing facts a current build would find. `enola upgrade` installs it.

### Not using an agent?

The gate is a plain CLI. No MCP, no hooks, no config file:

```bash
enola baseline pin      # freeze the architecture before you edit
#   …make your change…
enola check             # grade it - exit 1 on a structural regression
```

Same command and same exit code in CI, on every pull request. Every flag and all four exit codes: **[docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md)**.

## Try it on your own repo, right now

One read-only command, no baseline, no setup, nothing written to disk:

```bash
enola --explain /path/to/your/repo
```

On this repository that takes 292ms and prints, among other sections:

```

  complexity outliers        15
    internal/server.Server.registerTools         complexity 177
```

Reading that table: **fan-in** is how many imports point at a module, **fan-out** how many point out of it, and **blast radius** how many distinct modules a change there could reach, following imports backwards up to three hops. Ten files in one module importing yours is ten imports but one module, which is why fan-in is often the larger number.

If those numbers look right for your codebase, the rest of enola is the same measurement with a `before` to compare against.

## What the verdict tells you

A verdict you can't act on is just a red light. Here is the `billing`/`invoice` run from the top of this page in full - verbatim output, nothing trimmed:

```
FAIL - 1 structural regression introduced.

Regressions (fail):
  - [cycles] 1.00 - Cyclic dependency detected (2 modules)
      module "billing" is part of the cycle

Policy: fail on new findings from [cycles] at confidence >= 1.00.

What changed
  symbols      +1
  dependencies +2
  edges        +5  (imports +2, calls +2, declares +1)

Added (3):
  symbol     invoice.Retry                                invoice/invoice.go:7
  dependency billing -> acme/shop/invoice                 billing/billing.go:3
  dependency invoice -> acme/shop/billing                 invoice/invoice.go:3

New coupling (5):
  billing                                      --imports--> invoice
  invoice                                      --imports--> billing
  billing.Charge                               --calls--> invoice.Render
  invoice.Retry                                --calls--> billing.Charge
  invoice.Retry                                --declares--> invoice
```

Every line is the change, and nothing else. Two packages here, for readability - but on a 68,000-fact repository already carrying 268 findings it behaves identically, reporting the one thing this change introduced and none of the other 268.

## The loop

**Before a change**, your agent has the real structure of the codebase: a deterministic graph of modules, symbols, routes and storage, and how they depend on each other, extracted from source rather than inferred. It can look up what actually depends on the thing it's about to touch, instead of guessing from a grep.

**After a change**, enola grades what happened. It compares against the pinned graph and reports the delta: findings introduced or resolved, coupling added, symbols added and removed. It shows you everything the change actually did, and stays silent about everything that was already there.

It runs in three places, each usable on its own:

| | |
|---|---|
| **In your agent** | a hook grades each session and hands the verdict back, so the agent fixes its own regression before telling you it's done |
| **In your shell** | `enola check` - exits `1` on a structural regression |
| **In CI** | the same command, same exit code, on every pull request - or [`enola-action`](https://github.com/enola-labs/enola-action), which wires it to the pull-request base for you |

Add the CI gate from **[Enola Architecture Check on the GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/enola-architecture-check)**,
or start from the [complete workflow example](examples/ci/architecture-gate.yml).

The whole loop on this repository, unedited - a helper is added, the check fails on the cycle it closed, the diff shows what has to change, and the same command lets it through once it's fixed:

![enola check on its own repository: a helper added to pkg/facts closes a dependency cycle, enola fails the change, the diff replaces the import with an injected interface, and the re-run passes](docs/images/story2-gate.gif)

<sub>121 findings already in this repository. The check names the one the change added - and `&& echo` never fires while the gate is red.</sub>

## What fails the build

By default, one thing: a **dependency cycle** that your change just created.

A cycle is when two modules end up depending on each other. `billing` imports `invoice`, and `invoice` imports `billing` - either directly, as in the example above, or the long way round through five other modules. Once that happens, neither one can be built, tested, or read on its own any more, and every future change to one of them drags the other along. It is easy to create by accident and almost invisible in review, because no single file looks wrong.

**Everything else enola finds is reported, but never fails your build:**

- a single function or type that a large part of the codebase depends on (`god-class`)
- a function that nearly everything calls (`hotspots`)
- an import chain ten modules deep (`dependency-depth`)
- code reaching across a layer it shouldn't, like a UI file talking straight to the database (`layers`)
- a function far more complicated than the rest of your code (`complexity-outliers`)
- a package that exports almost everything it contains, instead of a small surface (`exported-surface`)
- API routes that nothing in the code you loaded ever calls (`unused-routes`)

**Why the line is there.** A cycle is a fact - the loop is either in the import graph or it isn't (Tarjan's SCC algorithm, confidence `1.00`). The rest are estimates, measured against your own repository: "this file has unusually many dependents *for this codebase*." An estimate that breaks the build is an estimate people learn to switch off, so enola enforces the facts and reports the estimates.

### Changing what counts

| You want | Run |
|---|---|
| The default: fail only on new cycles | `enola check` |
| Also fail on layer violations | `enola check --fail-on=cycles,layers` |
| ...but only when enola is quite sure | `enola check --fail-on=cycles,layers --min-confidence=0.8` |
| Report everything, fail nothing | `enola check --warn-only` |
| Fail if the change spread outside the area you named | `enola check --target=internal/auth --max-spillover=0` |

The names in brackets above are enola's individual checks - it calls them **explainers**, one per kind of finding - and they are exactly what `--fail-on` accepts, along with `cycles`, `coverage`, `crossrepo` and `intent`.

That last row is a different question from the others. `--target` is you saying *"this change is about `internal/auth`"*; enola works out which packages depend on it, then reports any package your change touched that isn't in that group - something you edited that your own description didn't cover. Two snapshots can tell you what changed; only you can say what you meant to change.

<details>
<summary><b>Three things that will bite you</b></summary>

- **`--fail-on` replaces the default, it doesn't add to it.** `--fail-on=layers` stops failing on cycles. Write `--fail-on=cycles,layers` if you want both.
- **A misspelled name is not an error.** It just never matches anything, so the gate goes quiet instead of complaining. `enola check --json` prints the policy that actually ran - compare it against what you typed.
- **`--warn-only` silences findings, not problems.** enola still exits non-zero if the check couldn't run at all (`2`), or if the baseline isn't comparable to the current code (`3`). Only findings are downgraded to warnings.

The policy lives in flags, not in `mcp-arch.yaml`, so a pre-commit hook and a CI job can deliberately hold you to different standards.

</details>

## Why not CodeGraph, graphify, or codebase-memory-mcp?

Several open-source projects turn a repository into a queryable graph for an AI agent. They are well built and they optimize for different things:

| | Optimizes for |
|---|---|
| CodeGraph | returning the matching source in the payload, so the agent never opens a file |
| graphify | code alongside PDFs and transcripts in one knowledge base |
| codebase-memory-mcp | indexing Kubernetes manifests next to code, in C, on in-memory SQLite |
| **enola** | the graph **plus a before/after verdict** - `check` exits `1`, so it can gate a build |

All of them answer *what does this codebase look like*. enola also answers *what did this change just do to it*, which is why it pins a baseline and why it has an exit code.

A benchmark-backed teardown of all four - storage engines, memory profiles, what each choice costs, and where each of the others is the better pick - is here, with links to every project: **[Four code graphs, four storage engines](https://menges.dev/writing/four-code-graphs-four-storage-engines/)**.

### And what about the tools you already have?

| | Tells you |
|---|---|
| **Git diff** | which lines changed |
| **Tests** | whether the behaviour you tested still works |
| **Linter** | whether local rules were violated, file by file |
| **Code review** | whatever a human notices, after the work is finished |
| **`enola check`** | **what the change did to the structure of the system** |

A dependency cycle spans files, breaks no test, and is easy for a reviewer to miss. AI agents can write more code than you can carefully review; that gap is where structural damage accumulates, and it usually surfaces months later when the package is too tangled to refactor.

## How it works

enola parses your source with tree-sitter and language-specific extractors, normalizes it into a typed fact model, links it into a directed graph, and runs graph algorithms over it: Tarjan's SCC to find groups of modules that can all reach each other (a cycle), cycle-safe longest-path for the deepest import chain, and mean+2σ outlier tests to flag what sits two standard deviations above your own repository's average. No language model, no embeddings. Terms enola uses in its own output are defined in **[docs/GLOSSARY.md](docs/GLOSSARY.md)**.

**Deterministic.** The same commit yields the same answer, every time: across 72 open-source repositories indexed three times each, all 72 produced a byte-identical snapshot ID and a byte-identical fact file, over 6.8 million facts with zero parse errors ([BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md)). Every snapshot carries a **receipt**: enola's version, the git ref and whether the tree was dirty, the extractors used, and a snapshot ID that's a `sha256` fingerprint of the facts rather than a random UUID. Before comparing two snapshots, enola checks they were built the same way - a different extractor set or changed ignore rules makes a diff meaningless, and it reports that instead of treating the mismatch as your change.

**Fast enough for every commit.** On that same corpus, a warm re-index of an unchanged tree took 6.8s for grafana (10,313 files, 167,987 facts) and 49.6s for the Linux kernel (55,399 files, 1.9M facts). Full per-repository numbers, cold and warm, are in [BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

**Local.** enola runs as a local binary reading local files. Nothing leaves your machine, and there is no license check anywhere in this repository.

**[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** has the fact model, the pipeline, the MCP tool reference and the analysis internals.

## Beyond one repository

Point enola at your backend *and* the things that call it - a web app, a mobile app, another service - and it joins them into one graph. Your agent can then answer the question that normally costs you a morning and two colleagues:

> *If I change this endpoint, what breaks?*

It joins the two sides wherever they meet: a web client's `fetch()` to the route that serves it, a mobile app's call to that same route (an iOS endpoint enum, an Android Retrofit interface), a gRPC call to the service behind it, one service's Kafka producer to another's consumer.

**The hard part is that the two sides rarely spell the endpoint the same way.** Your frontend calls `/api/courses`. Your backend file says:

```go
r.HandleFunc("/courses", listCourses)
```

The `/api` was attached somewhere else entirely - in whatever function set this router up, quite possibly in another package. Compare the two strings literally and you find nothing, so enola follows that prefix across function and package boundaries (*interprocedurally*) and files the route under the address it actually answers on: `/api/courses`. Same story for Axum's `.nest()`, Rails' `scope` and `namespace`, and a Swift endpoint enum whose version prefix lives three files away in a protocol extension.

Once both ends line up, `enola check` grades a change spanning two repos exactly the way it grades one that doesn't.

**It also tells you what it missed.** Some calls can't be resolved - a URL assembled at runtime, a client library enola doesn't know - and a tool that quietly drops those looks identical to one that found everything:

```bash
enola coverage cluster.yaml
```

That reports, per service, how many outbound calls it found, how many it matched to a route, and **how many it couldn't**. Which is the difference between a service that genuinely talks to nothing and a service whose edges enola just failed to follow.

[`examples/cross-repo/`](examples/cross-repo/) is a two-service demo you can run in one command. It contains one deliberately unresolvable call, so you can see what a miss looks like before you go looking for them in your own code.

## Staying current

enola releases often. It checks for a new release at most once every 12 hours, in the background, and caches the answer in `~/.enola/update.json` - no command ever waits on the network, and a machine that is offline behaves exactly like one that is up to date. When there is a newer release, `enola check`, `enola --generate` and `enola doctor` say so in one line, and `enola upgrade` installs it.

The notice reports one thing beyond the version: whether the **extractors** changed. That is the bit worth acting on - it means snapshots taken with your build are missing facts a current enola would extract, which is a data problem rather than a housekeeping one. Your agent gets the same notice once per session over MCP, worded so it tells you rather than upgrading your machine mid-task.

It is silent for builds from source, never runs when `CI` is set, and turns off entirely with `export ENOLA_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

## Found it useful?

If `enola --explain` told you something about your codebase you didn't already know, a star helps other people find it.

And if it missed something it should have caught - an unresolved edge, a route it didn't match, a language construct it walked past - [open an issue](https://github.com/enola-labs/enola/issues). Coverage gaps are the most useful bug reports this project gets, because `enola coverage` is built on the premise that a miss should be visible rather than quiet.
