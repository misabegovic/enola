// Package hotspots flags "pinch point" symbols that sit on many call paths —
// symbols with both high fan-in and high fan-out. These chokepoints are where
// most call chains converge and re-fan-out, so they are disproportionately
// risky to change and valuable to test.
//
// This is a cheap degree-centrality proxy for betweenness centrality: rather
// than the O(V·E) Brandes algorithm over the whole call graph, it scores each
// node by fanIn × fanOut, which strongly correlates with being on many paths.
