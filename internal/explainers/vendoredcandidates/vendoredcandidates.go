// Package vendoredcandidates reports directories that LOOK like in-tree copies of
// somebody else's project, so the reader can decide whether to exclude them.
//
// It never excludes anything. That is the whole design, and it is a correction of
// an earlier attempt that did: a rule keyed on directory name plus a licence file
// pruned the tree automatically, and it deleted 671 files of a repository's own
// source along with the dependencies it was aiming at. Nothing said so — the code
// was simply absent from the graph, and the fact count went DOWN, which is the one
// direction a regression check reads as success.
//
// The lesson is not that the heuristic needed another pass. It is that a heuristic
// must not be wired to an irreversible action. enola already has the mechanism for
// exclusion — the `ignore:` globs, which the reader writes and can read back — so
// the only thing missing was DISCOVERY: knowing which directories are worth
// looking at. That is a report, and a report is allowed to be wrong.
//
// So every finding here is Informational (never gradeable, never a CI failure),
// states the evidence rather than a verdict, and carries the exact ignore glob to
// paste if the reader agrees. What is indexed stays exactly what the reader's
// config says is indexed.
