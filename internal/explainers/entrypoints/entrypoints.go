// Package entrypoints marks the symbols a framework invokes directly, so
// reachability has roots to start from.
//
// Dead code was declined twice on the same measurement: 1,573 of 1,573 routed
// controller actions carry no inbound call edge, because routing is not a call.
// Neither is a queue draining a job, a mailer delivering, or a rake task
// running. Without roots, every one of them looks unreachable.
//
// The roots and the walk from them are the framework-roots binder's; this
// explainer reports them per mechanism and carries the reached share as the
// ceiling on what the graph can see. Reachability was measured before roots
// existed and reported 86% of the monolith's symbols unreachable, which is not
// a finding about the monolith: 53% of the Ruby extractor's call targets are
// bare method names, and a cross-object call cannot be followed until the
// receiver has a type. No dead-code verdict is derived here.
