// Package unusedroutes provides an explainer that summarizes server routes which
// no loaded client repo calls — endpoints the engine's cross-repo link pass
// flagged with the "unmatched_by_clients" prop — into "unused endpoint" candidate
// insights.
//
// The flag is computed structurally from the loaded snapshot only, so this
// explainer is deliberately careful to frame results as *candidates*: a route is
// listed because no client in the snapshot calls it, which is not the same as
// dead. Consumers outside the snapshot — admin/ops scripts, cron jobs, webhooks,
// third-party API clients, mobile deep links — do not appear here, so each
// candidate must be verified against those before removal.
