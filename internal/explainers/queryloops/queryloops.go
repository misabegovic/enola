// Package queryloops reports a database query issued once per iteration of a
// data-sized loop.
//
// It reports the shape it can prove and deliberately not the one everybody
// means by "N+1". The pitched detector was `record.association` inside a loop,
// and the funnel on a large Rails monolith ends at zero: 1,698 association-name
// reads in unbounded loops, 62 once bare `self.assoc` reads are dropped (Rails
// memoises those), 8 once thread-local receivers like `Current.company` are
// dropped, 7 after eager-loading — and all seven false.
// `Requisition#send_pusher_event!` reads `channel.trigger` where `channel` is a
// `PusherChannel`, matched only because `belongs_to :trigger` exists on an
// unrelated model. The graph has no receiver type inference for Ruby, so
// `candidate.posts` and `client.post` are the same string to it.
//
// A class-level query has no such problem: the receiver IS the type. When
// `AccessLevel.find_by` appears inside an unbounded loop, `AccessLevel` is a
// model this graph already knows and `find_by` is a query — nothing is
// inferred. 97 of these on that monolith.
//
// It also needs no eager-load suppression, and that is a property of the shape
// rather than a shortcut: `includes` cannot help a class-level `find_by`.
//
// The association-read shape does need two suppressions, both measured on the
// same monolith after the first tranche of fixes was judged: a read on an
// association the method has preloaded (`includes`, `preload`, `eager_load`)
// is a cache hit per element, not a query, and a read on a local the method
// typed with `new` is a record that was never saved, so its associations build
// in memory. Both come from facts the extractor now states (`preloads`,
// `unpersisted_locals`) rather than from anything inferred here.
//
// Rails states most preloads one hop away from the loop, so the block binding
// carries the chain the iterated relation was built from
// (`Current.company.users.allowed_to_login.preload`), and the walk back to the
// association collects the preloads stated on the way: by a scope on the
// element's model, by a same-class method the chain calls, by the method body
// itself. A collection that is nothing but a method parameter is typed by its
// name alone; that finding stays, at half the confidence and saying why. A
// method that hands its reads to BatchLoader.for is batched by construction.
//
// A finding also says where the loop runs, read from the file's place in the
// Rails layout: the request path, a background job, an admin action, shared
// code, or a one-off task (rake, maintenance tasks, migrations, seeders,
// development helpers). One-off tasks are informational, still reported and
// never graded; loops in spec and test files are not findings at all, since
// fixtures are iterated by design. Whether a loop is hot is still not
// measured; the surface is what the path states.
