// module count over that DAG. A small component contributes its full size to any
// chain passing through it (a genuine tangle deepens the chain). But an *oversized*
// component (> common.OversizedClusterModules) is an autoload coupling cluster, not
// deep layering — in Ruby/Rails mutual constant references collapse most of the app
// into one giant SCC. Such a cluster is therefore (a) weighted 0 (componentWeight)
// and (b) made a sink in the condensation (its outgoing edges are dropped), so a
// chain earns depth only from genuine, distinct-module layering above/outside the
// cluster and never by threading through it. Otherwise every chain reaching the
// cluster would report an inflated depth that merely restates the coupling the
// cycles explainer already reports as a "Highly coupled module cluster". A module's
// reported depth is its component's depth; one insight is emitted per component
// (keyed by its smallest member), so a small cycle yields a single finding rather
