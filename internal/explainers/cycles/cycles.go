// maxCycleModules is the largest SCC still reported as a discrete, actionable
// "Cyclic dependency". Larger components are reported as a coupling cluster
// instead, because advice like "introduce an interface" cannot meaningfully be
// applied to a 99-node component. Shared with the depth explainer via
// common.OversizedClusterModules.
//
// The distinction is about ACTIONABILITY and must never touch confidence. A
// cluster is every bit as certain as a cycle — it *is* a cycle, a larger one —
// and confidence in this codebase means "is this real", which is what
// min_confidence filters and the check gate threshold read. Encoding "is this
// easy to fix" in the same number made severity fall as the problem grew:
// adding an edge that pushed an 8-module cycle to 10 resolved a 1.0 finding and
// replaced it with a 0.4 advisory, so a strictly worse graph reported as an
// improvement and passed a gate it had previously failed.

	//
	// Constant references are excluded for the same reason one step further out.
	// An autoloaded constant reference is a COUPLING claim, not a LOAD-ORDER
	// claim: under Zeitwerk `Billing::Invoice.call` inside app/models resolves
	// when the line runs, so the two directories can reference each other freely
	// and nothing about the boot sequence is at stake. Grading them here made the
	// finding say a thing that is not true of the codebase — and made it useless
	// besides, since every app/* directory calls every other by design, so a flat
	// Rails app reports one blob spanning nearly its whole tree and no cycle a
	// team could act on. What survives the exclusion is the load-order claim
	// proper: inheritance and mixins, which the class body evaluates at
	// definition time, `require`, which is a load instruction, and a packwerk
	// dependency, which the app declared itself. Nothing is deleted by this: the
	// reference edges stay in the fact store, the depth explainer still builds
	// the whole graph from them, and anything asking what couples to what still
	// gets the same answer. What narrows is only the graph the gated finding is
	// derived from.
	// Rolled-up call edges are excluded for the same reason associations are:
	// they are real coupling and a poor cycle oracle. A directory pair joined
	// because one method somewhere called another is not a load-order defect,
	// and admitting them merged this estate's small, nameable cycles into one
	// 508-module blob (46 cycles and 3 clusters became 40 and 4). The edges
	// stay in the store for the readings that want coupling rather than
	// cycles: the metrics suite, impact, and the layer rules.
