// Package coverage provides an explainer that turns the per-service edge_coverage
// counts recorded by internal/linkers/crossrepo into "coverage gap" insights.
//
// A service node with no outbound dependencies can mean two very different things:
// it is genuinely a leaf, or enola detected outbound call sites it could not
// resolve to a target. This explainer surfaces the latter so a human knows where
// the map is thin and worth verifying against source, rather than assuming the
// service is isolated.
