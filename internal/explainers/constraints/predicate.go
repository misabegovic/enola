// A component's where predicate is evaluated here: the conjunction of property
// tests that decides membership by what a fact carries rather than by where its
// file sits. Every pair must hold — there is no or and no negation — and each
// pair holds when the declared value is one whole member of the prop's measured
// value, which is exactly equality for the scalar props and containment for the
// space-joined set props (columns, fk_constraints, decorators) the require
// form's when_prop_contains already reads that way. One semantic, not two: a
// scalar decomposes into a single token, so "contains that token" and "equals
// that value" are the same statement about it.
//
// A value written as a numeric comparison — ">=5" — is a threshold instead, and
// holds when the prop's measured value is a number satisfying it. The grammar
// is shared with the validator (intent.ParseThreshold), so a threshold that
// parsed at declaration time parses the same way here.

// unmeasuredPropConfidence is deliberately the gate-failing 1.0 rather than the
// 0.4 the dead-selector and absent-service advisories sit at, and the
// difference is the point. Those two report a selector that resolved to nothing
// for a reason the snapshot cannot distinguish from a moved tree or an unloaded
// repo. A where naming a property no measured fact carries is not ambiguous: it
// is a declaration this snapshot cannot evaluate at all, and the resulting
// membership would be empty for a reason that has nothing to do with the code.
// Every rule over an empty component holds, which reads exactly like
// compliance, so this one is stated at full confidence and the rules naming the
// component are silenced rather than allowed to pass vacuously.
