//   - because is the sentence the finding quotes.
//   - source is the file the rule was declared in. Moving a rule between
//     constraints files judges nothing differently.
//   - recipe and instance are the provenance a recipe expansion stamps.
//     Relabelling an instance changes what a verdict SAYS, never what it
//     decides.
//   - exempt is excluded because it is not one term: it is a set of carve-outs
//     each naming its own witness, and comparing the set as a blob makes an
//     exemption added for witness X answer for witness Y. Y then landed in
//     "the breaching code is unchanged; the law stopped asking" — a false
