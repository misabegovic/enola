	//     claiming it inverted the enclosing directory's own layer. 17 of one

//	Python   The obvious gap — 2,265 unnamed modules across two repositories —
//	         and the vocabulary does not survive comparison. One workflow engine's
//	         recurring segments are hooks, operators, sensors and providers, which
//	         are its own PLUGIN KINDS sitting at one level rather than layers; a
//	         commerce platform's are graphql, mutations and migrations; an
//	         analytics platform's are commands and views; a library's are modules,
//	         infrastructure and tasks. What repeats across all four is `utils` and
//	         `common`. There is no Python layer vocabulary to encode, only four
//	         project vocabularies.
//
//	Rust     Three repositories, three unrelated layouts: an async runtime whose
//	         directories are domain modules (runtime, sync, io, net, time), a web
//	         application with routes/controllers/models, and a compiler split into
//	         crates named for products. Rust's unit of structure is the crate, and
//	         a crate boundary is already visible in the graph without a taxonomy
//	         inventing layers above it.
//
//	Swift    An SPM package's directories under Sources/ are TARGET names, which
//	         are products rather than tiers. The ios-clean taxonomy already covers
//	         the app layouts that do use layer names.
//
//	Go (web) One repository in the corpus uses the widely-copied
//	         routers/services/models/modules layout rather than the standard one,
//	         and adding those words to go-standard would re-rank pkg/services and
//	         pkg/models in every Go repository that has them — a change measured
//	         against one example, affecting many.
//
//	.NET     Beyond the clean-architecture layout already covered, the five .NET
//	         repositories in the corpus share no order. A modular CMS keeps
//	         Views/Services/ViewModels inside each of a thousand Modules; a
//	         component library has Components/Pages/Services; a UI framework and a
//	         file manager have product names. And the one that looks most like a
//	         layered application is the trap: a media server's
//	         `MediaBrowser.Controller` is its DOMAIN ABSTRACTIONS assembly —
//	         IServerApplicationHost.cs, Entities/, Dto/ — so a taxonomy matching
//	         the word Controller across dotted project names, which is how the
//	         .NET one has to match, would read fifty modules of interfaces as a
//	         delivery layer. Same failure as `core` in the hexagonal patterns: a
//	         word that names something else here.
//
// Each of these is worth revisiting when the corpus holds two or more unrelated
// repositories that agree. One repository is a validation; it is not evidence of
// a convention.

// outcome; bestPattern selects by specificity then confidence.

// wp-includes — and costs a right one: a Java platform's Angular front end is
// 232 of 269 modules at 99% obedience, and its distinctive evidence is 54 `pages`
// directories plus a single `directives`. No absolute threshold separates those
// two, because what is wrong about the WordPress claim is not its size but that
// the code is somebody else's; and no relative one does either, since a correct
// Angular match sits at 3% signature share and the wrong PHP one at 20%.
//
// So the wrong statement stays, recorded as a known gap in the benchmark corpus
// rather than tuned away with a threshold that takes a correct one with it. The
// real fix is excluding vendored trees from architecture the way test trees

// ONLY `imports` IS READ, AND THAT WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The obvious

// find. It does not survive contact with the corpus. Resolving every one of those
// edges to a module pair (symbol name to its declaring module, names declared in
// two modules dropped as ambiguous) and subtracting the pairs `imports` already
// yields:
//
//	a Rails monolith        150 new module pairs   0 of them wrong-direction
//	a Spring application     680 new module pairs   0
//	a Go application         779 new module pairs   0
//	a Rails + Angular app   1455 new module pairs   5
//
// Three thousand pairs for five findings, every one of them the same shape as
// findings the import edges already reported — and bought with a resolution step
// whose unresolved tail runs from 27,000 to 105,000 targets per repository, each
// one a chance to attribute an edge to the wrong module.
//
// The premise was wrong twice. In every language here a reference across a module
// boundary requires an import, so `calls` is a SUBSET of `imports` once both are
// reduced to module granularity. And the autoloaded language is not an exception:
// the Ruby extractor synthesizes coupling edges from constant references, which is
// why a Rails monolith with no `require` in its application code still has 11,486
// import edges. Where a Rails taxonomy reports nothing it is because that taxonomy
// deliberately collapses its domain directories to one tier, not because the
// evidence is missing.

// detectViolations checks for layer boundary violations (inner layer importing
// outer layer). Each distinct (source module -> target module) pair is reported

// import targets (`./x`, `../y`) are resolved against the source module the same
// way the shared module-graph builder does, so JS/TS-style relative imports match
// a classified layer instead of silently missing. Output is sorted for
