// Declared layer patterns — the layer-intent half of intent compilation. A
// repo whose intent facts declare layers gets its pattern built from the
// declaration at confidence 1.0 (a declared taxonomy is stated, not
// recognised) and verdicted by the SAME violation machinery the heuristic
// patterns use; repos without declarations keep the heuristic path untouched.
//
// Ordering is outermost-first: earlier entries may depend on later ones,
// never the reverse. Level runs opposite to declaration order (the last,
// innermost entry has the lowest level) so the existing wrong-direction test
// reads unchanged.
//
// Glob support is deliberately the ceiling the layer-intent decision set:
// an exact module path, or a `prefix/**` subtree — nothing more.

// declaredPatterns builds the archPattern for the one repo named by repo, out
// of the declarations that name it as their owner. A declaration governs the
// codebase it is written for and nothing else: read across a union, one repo's
// declared taxonomy verdicted another repo's imports wherever their module names
// happened to collide, and reported it at confidence 1.0.

// that sentence, and a reporter on Windows read past it exactly as anyone would.
//
// Two advisories rather than one, because the two failures need different fixes.
// Nothing classified at all is usually one systematic mistake — a wrong root, or
// paths in a dialect the matcher does not read. A single empty layer among
