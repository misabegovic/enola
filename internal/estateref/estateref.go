// Package estateref keeps the names of the private repositories this tree is
// measured against out of the tree itself.
//
// Almost every comment here that carries a number earned it on a real
// repository, and naming that repository beside the number is the natural way
// to write it down. It is also how the name travels: this folder is the one
// that can reach a contribution, so a comment citing a measurement by the
// repository it was measured on carries that repository's name with it.
//
// Removing the names downstream, on the branch a contribution is prepared
// from, does not hold. One refresh from this folder put nineteen of them back,
// and they had to be removed by hand a second time. The check therefore runs
// where the references are written, in the normal test gate, so a refresh that
// reintroduces one fails immediately and names it.
//
// The names are not written down here. They are read at test time from a file
// outside this tree, kept where a carve cannot reach it, because a denylist is
// an inventory: eleven names and a person in one machine-readable slice hand a
// reader in a single file what sixty scattered comments only hinted at. Where
// that file is absent — which is what this tree looks like once it has been
// split out on its own — there is nothing to check, and the check skips and
// says why. Everything else in this package is exercised either way.
//
// What is neutralised is the identity and never the evidence. "3,392 of 3,732
// routes unmatched" is why the code around it is shaped as it is; the name of
// the repository it was measured on is not. A comment that drops the number to
// lose the name is worse than the name.
