// ConstraintComponent names a set of measured facts by where they live: any
// fact whose file falls under a match pattern (and, when narrowed, whose kind
// or name agrees) is a member. Components exist so rules can speak about
// the architecture in the declaration's own vocabulary — "the domain", "the
// adapters" — instead of repeating path lists per rule. Service scopes the
// selector to one repository of a multi-repo snapshot, by its exact repo
// label: members are facts of that repo, and every other narrowing ANDs with
// it. A component may carry a service with no match patterns — that is the
// whole service — where a serviceless component still needs at least one.
//
// NamePattern narrows to a family of fact names rather than to one name: it
// speaks the bounded name dialect ValidNamePattern admits and MatchBoundedName
// applies — an exact name, one prefix*, or one *suffix — which is the same
// pair require_name's pattern and require's when_edge_to are held to. A
// starless pattern is exact equality, so what a component selected before the
// dialect reached it, it selects still. Sharing the validator with the matcher
// is the point: a name family a declaration may write and a name family the
// evaluator recognizes cannot come apart.
//
// Where selects by what the facts CARRY instead of where they sit: a
// conjunction of property tests over the props the extractors measured, so a
// component can name "the view components" or "the storage models" without a
// directory appearing anywhere. It ANDs with every other narrowing for the
// same reason service does — every field on this struct narrows, none widens —
// so a component carrying both a match and a where is the path scope
// intersected with the predicate, which is how a trusted path scope gets
// sharpened without being replaced. A where alone is legal and needs no match:
// the predicate IS the selector.

// through ANY measured path — the transitive form, walked breadth-first under
// a hard depth cap; Via narrows the walked edge kinds and defaults to every
// rule-via kind), Allow/Only (this component's edges may land only in the
// named components), Protect/Owners (only the named components may reach this
// one — the ownership form, walked from the whole graph rather than from a
// source component), Private/Except (the component's non-exported members may
// be reached only from inside the component or from the Except components —
// the visibility form, verdicted over every rule-via edge kind against the
// extractor-measured exported prop, so it needs no Via of its own), ForbidFact
// (this component's membership must be empty), Cap/MaxMembers (this
// component's membership must not exceed a count), or Require (members of this
// component matching WhenPropContains must satisfy MustPropContain — the
// property form, verdicting what a member fact carries rather than what edges
// it makes; "every storage member whose columns contain company_id must have
// fk_constraints containing company_id->companies". Its second antecedent,
// WhenEdgeTo/Via, selects on the member's OWN outgoing edges instead of on a
// prop it carries — "every getter that calls reactiveUnwrap must carry the
// cached decorator" — with the far end a literal, never a component, so the
// form still resolves entirely on the member fact. Both antecedents together
// narrow, never widen: a member must satisfy each declared one to be in
// scope), or RequireDefines/Method
// (every class-kind member symbol must have a measured method symbol of the
// given name — the protocol form; a class whose definition could ride a
// mixin, an included module, or a superclass is out of scope, fail closed,
// because the check cannot see through composition it did not measure), or
// RequireName/Pattern (every member fact's name must match a bounded
// convention pattern — prefix*, *suffix, or an exact name; the naming form
// speaks the same deliberately small dialect philosophy match does, so a
// pattern the evaluator would silently mis-apply cannot be declared), or
// RequireEdge/Via/Direction (every member must have at least one measured edge
// of the Via kind — inbound means some source points at the member, outbound
// means the member points somewhere — optionally scoped by To to a counterpart
// component; the existential form, demanding an edge EXISTS where every other
// edge form forbids one, so an orphaned event or an unconsumed route is a
// breach instead of invisible; a member whose edge visibility the snapshot
// cannot demonstrate for that file kind is skipped with a named count, fail
// closed, never silently compliant and never falsely violated), or
// Protocol/Steps/Via (every member of the protocol component that makes a Via
// edge into step K's members must also make Via edges into every step
// 1..K-1's members — the ordered form. What it verdicts is STRUCTURAL protocol
// conformance: a member referencing a later step's surface without referencing
// every prerequisite step's surface, which a static fact graph can decide. It
// is never a runtime-ordering claim — that step 1 is CALLED before step 2 at
// runtime is unverifiable from a static graph, so the compiled fact carries
// verification: structural and a future runtime provider owns the observed
// level. A member touching no step is a bystander the rule does not bind, and
// a member whose file class cannot demonstrate the Via kind is skipped with a
// named count, fail closed), or
// Guide/Message (steering, not law: advice surfaced to whoever is about to
// edit inside the component — "similar implementations here used X; consider
// it" — with optional Exemplars naming prior art by repo-relative file path
// or fact name; exemplar existence is checked at delivery time against the
// snapshot, never at parse time, because prior art may move without the
// advice going stale).
// Unlike a claim (a measurement expected to hold), a rule carries enforcement
// semantics: a breach is a decided-rule finding, and Because — mandatory — is
// the rationale the resulting finding surfaces, so a violation always says why
// the rule exists, not only that it was broken. Mode softens enforcement:
// ratchet (the default) verdicts at full confidence, advisory reports below
// the check gate's floor so the finding surfaces without failing anything.
// A guidance rule takes only the non-enforcing modes — notify (its default:
// contract/hook channel only, never a finding) or advisory — because
// graduation to law means writing a law form, not hardening this one.
