// Package crossrepo links the per-repo architectural graphs of an appended multi-repo
// fact set into a single cross-repo "graph of graphs".
//
// In multi-repo (append) mode, facts from several repositories live in one store, each
// tagged with a Repo label, but the graph only ever connects facts within a single
// repo. This package derives the edges BETWEEN repos — not by knowing how, but by
// running registered plugin.CrossRepoSignal implementations and materializing whatever
// evidence they report.
//
// The signals themselves live in signals/: HTTP route role matching, import references,
// Kafka topic ownership, and shared code. Each is independent, and a new one is a new
// package plus a registration line. This package owns only the parts that cannot belong
// to any single signal:
//
//   - the two-phase run (directional signals first, then symmetric ones, which may read
//     the direction the first phase established — see plugin.SignalPhase),
//   - evidence accumulation and materialization (evidence.go),
//   - the derived indexes signals share, computed lazily and at most once (input.go).
//
// The result is expressed as synthetic facts: one KindService node per repo and one
// KindDependency fact per pair. Only the directional ones (type="cross_repo") attach a
// depends_on relation to the consumer's service node; because these are ordinary facts,
// they flow into Store.BuildGraph and make every traversal tool (traverse, find_path,
// impact_analysis, query_facts) cross-repo aware with no per-tool changes. Keeping the
// symmetric signal out of that relation matters: traversal composes depends_on across
// hops, and shared code does not compose — a repo calling one side of a copy-paste pair
// does not thereby reach the other.
