// Package clientseam turns a repo's own HTTP helper into client routes.
//
// A Go service that wraps net/http in one project-local function disappears from
// the cross-repo graph. A Go CLI in this estate is the measured case: every call
// it makes is `api.Request[Task]("/me/tasks", …)`, the net/http call is two
// packages away inside a generic helper, and the per-file client extractor is
// gated on the file importing net/http — which the command files do not. The
// repo emitted ZERO client routes and the cluster reported that the service it
// calls appears isolated, while 14 of its 14 distinct literal paths match a
// server route in that service exactly.
//
// The work splits across two passes because neither half can be done alone. The
// extractor sees one package and records a CANDIDATE for every call passing a
// path-shaped literal — it cannot know whether the callee reaches net/http,
// because the callee is usually somewhere else. This binder sees the whole
// module and answers exactly that question, then emits the routes.
//
// It runs pre-link: these are the facts the cross-repo linker matches on, so
// producing them afterwards would mean producing them for nobody.
