// HandlerProp is the prop an extractor sets on a symbol whose SIGNATURE is an HTTP
// handler. It is how a language opts into this binder: emit the prop and the routes
// bind, emit nothing and nothing happens. There is no list of supported languages
// here by design — see the Binder doc.
const HandlerProp = "http_handler"

// Binder resolves each HTTP route to the symbol that serves it, emitting a
// handled_by edge — the same contract grpcimpl provides for gRPC.
//
// WHY IT IS NEEDED. An extractor renders a route's `handler` prop from the
// REGISTRATION site, so it is the receiver VARIABLE chain as written there:
//
//	handler prop : h.settingsAnalyticsHandlerV2.GetActiveRoles
//	real symbol  : internal/adapters/http/settings/analytics.HandlerV2.GetActiveRoles
//
// The receiver variable is not the receiver type, and the registration site is not
// the declaring package, so the two key spaces are disjoint: on fairwayhub/golf, 1397
// distinct handler props intersect 13482 symbol names in exactly TWO places (both
// Python), and 0 of 1641 routes carried a handled_by edge. Every consumer that keys
// off the handler — the performance analyzer's route-handler escalation, orphans'
// rescue of handler methods — was therefore matching nothing.
//
// WHY IT RESOLVES BY SIGNATURE. The only thing the two sides share is the METHOD
// NAME, and a method name alone is ambiguous. fairwayhub/golf has four
// GetDailyWeatherRange: the real handler, a domain service, a mock, and a null-object
// stub in the WIRING package where the routes happen to be registered — so both a
// name-only rule and a package-scoped rule bind the route to the stub. A wrong
// handled_by edge feeds impact_analysis and find_path, which is worse than the
// missing edge it replaces.
//
// A Go HTTP handler is exactly func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request). goextractor
// tags those with HandlerProp (v111), which is a structural fact from the parser, not
// a name heuristic — and it rejects the stub (signature `(ctx, string)`) by
// construction. Measured on fairwayhub/golf: 1254 of 1639 Go routes resolve, 212 are
// skipped as ambiguous, 16 are unresolved, 154 are middleware.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO LANGUAGE GATE. This used to test `language == "go"`, which made Go
// support a property of the ENGINE rather than of the Go extractor: adding TypeScript
// or Python meant editing a binder none of those extractors know about. The real
// precondition was never the language, it was the structural signature check that
// HandlerProp represents — a language with no handler-shaped signature emits the prop
// nowhere, indexes nothing, and binds nothing, which is the same outcome the language
// gate produced. Today only goextractor emits it, so dropping the gate changes no
// output; what it changes is who can opt in without touching this file.
//
// It is post-link: routes and handlers are matched strictly within one repo, so it
// neither reads nor feeds cross-repo linking.
