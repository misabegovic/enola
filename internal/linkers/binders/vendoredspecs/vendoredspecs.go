// Package vendoredspecs reclassifies OpenAPI specs that a client-only application
// vendors for code generation: routes it CALLS, not routes it serves.
//
// THE BUG THIS FIXES. The OpenAPI extractor defaults every spec to role=server and
// demotes to client only by directory convention (a "client" segment under an
// "openapi" one). Backend repos follow that convention; mobile apps generally do not,
// keeping each consumed service's spec in a per-feature openapi/ directory the code
// generator reads. Every one of those was indexed as a SERVED endpoint, making the app
// a match target for any repo calling the same paths: a mobile app that serves no HTTP
// at all can collect inbound dependencies from most of the backends around it, plus a
// crop of "endpoint no client calls" findings on routes it never served.
//
// WHY NOT A PATH RULE. The vendored specs sit in a bare openapi/ directory,
// byte-identical in shape to a service's own spec directory; no path convention
// separates them. And the tempting inverse — "a repo whose only server routes come
// from OpenAPI is not a server" — is false: spec-first services exist whose entire
// served surface is declared in api/openapi/*.yml and nowhere in code. Both shapes
// occur in one estate, so the rule has to rest on positive evidence about the repo
// rather than on the absence of evidence.

// clientOnlyRepos returns the repos whose OpenAPI specs must be vendored client

//	∃ route{source ∈ facts.NativeAppClientSources}  — the repo ships a native-app
//	                                                  HTTP client, so it is an app
//	∄ route{role ≠ client, source ≠ openapi}        — and nothing outside a spec
//	                                                  declares a served endpoint
//
// The first is positive evidence and does the real work: without it the second alone
// would misclassify every spec-first backend, whose served surface is declared only in
// its own OpenAPI files. The second is the guard that keeps a Kotlin or Swift repo that
// genuinely serves something (a Ktor service, a Vapor app) out of the set.
//
// A route with no role counts as a server route, per the facts.RoleServer contract — an
// extractor that found a declaration without a call site found a served endpoint. That
// deliberately includes UI/page routes: a repo serving browser routes is a web app, and
// leaving it untouched is the safe direction for a linker that everywhere prefers a
// missing edge to a fabricated one.
//
// PropVendoredSpec needs no special handling here even though this runs over a store
// that may already contain the binder's own output: only OpenAPI routes are ever
// rewritten, and the second condition skips OpenAPI routes entirely. The classification
// therefore reads the same before and after a demotion, which is what keeps the pass
// stable across appends instead of self-reinforcing.
