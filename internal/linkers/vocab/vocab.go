// Package vocab holds the tuning knowledge behind cross-repo linking: the word lists
// that decide which names are too generic to link on, the path markers that identify
// non-contract code, and the numeric thresholds the signals compare against.
//
// WHY IT IS A PACKAGE. All of it used to be `var`s and `const`s scattered across 1,800
// lines beside the code that read them. That made two things impossible. It was
// undiscoverable — nobody could see what enola believed about naming without reading
// the linker — and it was unreachable: a user hitting a false edge from a framework
// enola has never seen had no path but a Go patch and a release, even though the fix is
// invariably one more string in one more list.
//
// Nearly every accuracy fix to this linker has been exactly that: adding Rails base
// classes, adding UI-component words, adding generated-code path markers. Those are
// data changes wearing a code change's clothes.
//
// WHY IT IS ONLY DATA. A Set can add vocabulary and move thresholds. It cannot express
// a matching RULE, and deliberately so — a config language that could describe how to
// match would let a user manufacture an edge, and every fact in the graph is supposed
// to be derived rather than asserted. Widening what counts as "too generic to link on"
// can only ever REMOVE edges, which is the safe direction: the linker's governing bias
// is that a missing edge beats a wrong one.
