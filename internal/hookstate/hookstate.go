// Package hookstate records when enola's agent hooks last ran.
//
// It exists because of a defect that no test in this repository could have caught.
// `enola install --hooks` wrote the Stop hook in a JSON shape the agent ignored, so
// the hooks never fired — and every cheaper check passed while it was broken: the
// installer wrote the file it meant to, the hook binary produced the right verdict
// when invoked by hand, and a unit test asserted the shape against the same belief
// that produced it.
//
// The shape of that config is a contract owned by the agent, which ships on its own
// schedule and can change after enola is released. So it is not testable here in any
// durable way: the only defence that survives the contract moving is noticing, on the
// machine where it matters, that the hooks have stopped firing.
//
// Hence a heartbeat. Every hook invocation records that it ran — INCLUDING the runs
// where it deliberately says nothing, which is the overwhelming majority and the whole
// point. Silence was the defect's entire signature; a hook that has never fired is now
// distinguishable from one that fires and finds nothing to report.
