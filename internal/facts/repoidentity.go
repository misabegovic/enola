// ".git" removed. "" for input it cannot make sense of.
//
//	git@github.com:org/repo.git            -> github.com/org/repo
//	https://github.com/org/repo.git        -> github.com/org/repo
//	https://x-token:abc@github.com/org/repo -> github.com/org/repo
//	ssh://git@github.com:22/org/repo       -> github.com/org/repo
//
// The point is that the SAME repository must normalize identically however it was
// cloned — a CI runner using an HTTPS URL with a token and a developer using SSH are
// looking at one repository, and a comparison that says otherwise would decline to grade
// every CI diff.
//
// Lowercasing the path as well as the host is deliberate. Hosts are case-insensitive by
// spec; repository paths are case-insensitive on the major forges, so "Org/Repo" and
// "org/repo" are one repository, and treating them as two would produce exactly the
// false mismatch this function exists to prevent. The cost is that a forge which does
// distinguish them would see two repositories as one — a far rarer situation, and one
// that fails toward comparing rather than toward refusing.

// SameRepo reports whether two snapshots describe the same repository, without relying

//
// A baseline pinned on a CI runner at /home/runner/work/app/app and a working copy at
// /Users/dev/src/app are the same repository, and comparing absolute paths said they were
// not — which made every restored baseline artifact decline to grade.
//
// Two signals, strongest first:
//
//  1. Normalized remotes, when BOTH sides have one. This is a real identity: it survives
//     relocation, re-cloning and a shallow checkout.
//  2. Otherwise the checkout directory name. Weaker — two unrelated repositories both
//     checked out as "api" look alike — but it is what is available for a repo with no
//     remote, and it is the case the absolute-path comparison already got wrong.
//
// A missing RepoPath on either side yields true: nothing can be concluded, and inventing
// a mismatch out of absent data would block a diff for no reason.

// It is the same two signals SameRepo compares, exposed as a value so a caller can
// RECORD an identity rather than only compare two snapshots that both happen to be in
// hand. Anything that persists a reference to a repository across machines needs that:
// an absolute path names where a checkout sits on one machine and identifies nothing
// anywhere else, so a stored path can never be reconciled with the same repository seen
// from a CI runner, from a second workstation, or from the same machine after the
// directory is moved.
//
// Deliberately NOT expressed as "the thing SameRepo compares": SameRepo answers true for
// a missing RepoPath on either side (nothing can be concluded, and inventing a mismatch
// would block a diff for no reason), which is the right answer to "are these the same?"
// and the wrong one to "what is this?".
