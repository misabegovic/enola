import "strings"

// This file is the SHARED VOCABULARY that crosses the extractor -> linker boundary.
//
// An extractor writes a prop value; a linker, binder or explainer in a different
// package reads it back and changes its behavior based on the exact string. That makes
// the value a contract between two packages that never reference each other — and until
// these constants existed, both sides simply spelled the literal out and hoped.
//
// They did not always agree. The cross-repo linker classified an edge as
// via="http-client" from a private list of ten `source` values; the Java extractor emits
// two more ("java-http-client", "feign") that were never added to it, so every Java
// RestTemplate and Feign call site linked as a generic OpenAPI-style "http" edge. No test
// failed, because nothing tied the writing side to the reading side. That is the class of
// bug this file exists to make impossible: the values live here, beside the registry that
// consumes them, and TestContractVocabulary_NoUnregisteredLiterals fails the build if an
// extractor spells one out by hand.
//
// SCOPE. Only values that are READ outside the package that writes them belong here. A
// `framework` value no one branches on (e.g. "gorilla/mux") is descriptive metadata, not
// a contract, and stays a literal at its emission site.

// Prop keys whose VALUES form a cross-package contract (below). Only these keys are
// listed: this is not a general prop-key namespace, and the many descriptive props
// (line counts, exported flags, complexity metrics) deliberately stay literals.
