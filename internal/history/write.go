// Package history writes enola's architecture history — the append-only log of
// revisions a repository has passed through. The read side, and the format contract, are

// The split is not ceremony. pkg/history must stay importable by anything that only
// wants to LOOK at a history, which means importing nothing but pkg/facts and the
// standard library and building with CGO_ENABLED=0. Writing needs the file lock and the
// engine's notion of when a snapshot happened, so it lives here, inside.
