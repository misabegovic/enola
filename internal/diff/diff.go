// Package diff computes the delta between two architecture snapshots.
//
// Unlike a linter, which judges a snapshot against an external ideal, a diff
// judges the current snapshot against the codebase's OWN prior state. That makes
// it a ratchet rather than a ruler: it reports only what CHANGED — facts added or
// removed, new coupling edges, findings that newly appeared or were resolved —
// and stays silent about pre-existing state. A pattern that was "wrong" before and
// after (e.g. an API-first route with no loaded consumer) produces no delta, so
// the diff is structurally immune to the false-signal problem.
//
// Compute is pure and deterministic: identical inputs always yield byte-identical
// output (every collection is sorted by a stable key), so a diff is reproducible
// and even diffs-of-diffs are stable.
