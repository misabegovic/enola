// KindTable maps a grammar's symbol ids to their names, so a node's kind can be read
// without allocating.
//
// go-tree-sitter's Node.Kind() is `C.GoString(C.ts_node_type(...))`: a fresh Go string
// built from a C string on every single call. The C string it copies is already
// interned — it points into the grammar's static symbol-name table — so the copy buys
// nothing and the allocation is pure loss.
//
// It is not a small loss. Measured on a cold snapshot of dotnet/runtime: 180 M
// allocations and 3.28 GB, 18% of everything the run allocated and 42% of every object
// it created, from this one call. On an isolated AST walk, replacing it halves the
// allocation count outright.
//
// The table is the same strings by a different route: ts_language_symbol_name of the
// node's symbol id. That the two always agree is not obvious from the API — aliased
// nodes resolve their symbol differently — so it is asserted rather than assumed, over
// every node of a real corpus, by each extractor's own kind-table test.

// KindsFor returns the table for a grammar, building it once per process.
//
// The key is the grammar pointer that tree-sitter's Go bindings expose — the same
// value the caller hands to sitter.NewLanguage — which is a stable address in the
// compiled grammar rather than a per-parse wrapper. Passing the grammar the parser
// was actually configured with is the caller's side of the bargain: a table from one
// grammar read against another's ids returns plausible, wrong kind names, and nothing
// downstream would notice. Extractors that parse with more than one grammar therefore
// carry the table alongside the language rather than in a package-level variable.
