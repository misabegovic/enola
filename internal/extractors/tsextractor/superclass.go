// superclassProp is the base class a class extends, exactly as the source writes
// it and one level only — the same meaning rubyextractor gives the prop, so an
// architecture rule about a base class reads the same in both languages.
//
// superclassModuleProp is the module that identifier was imported from. It is
// what the Ruby prop does not need: a Ruby superclass token is a globally
// resolvable constant, while a JavaScript one is bound by an import and means
// whatever that file imported. `Controller` is @hotwired/stimulus' base class in
// one file and @ember/controller's in the next — measured over one production
// Ember frontend's 4,417 class facts, 150 against 259 — and a prop carrying
// only the identifier fuses them. The module is read from the file's own import
// table and from nowhere else: never from the identifier's spelling, never from
// the file's path.
