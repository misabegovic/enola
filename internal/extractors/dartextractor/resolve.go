// This file holds the passes that run after every file has been walked, because none of
// them can be decided from one file alone.

// resolveCallTargets rewrites bare reference targets to the canonical symbol they name.
//
// The walker emits a call target as it is WRITTEN (`fetch`, `User.named`) because a
// receiver's static type is not tracked and a file cannot see another file's
// declarations. This pass binds those against the assembled symbol set.
//
// The binding rule is deliberately narrow: a name is rewritten only when the project
// declares EXACTLY ONE symbol with it. An ambiguous short name is left bare, which is
// the outcome that matters — a bare target still lets dead-code matching see the symbol
// used, while a target picked from several candidates would be a fabricated edge into
// whichever module happened to sort first. `build`, `dispose`, `toJson` and `copyWith`
// are declared by hundreds of types in any Flutter app, so this is the common case and
// not the corner one.

// attributeSymbolsToModules gives every symbol a leading `declares` edge to the module
// that declares it.
//
// This is the convention the Go extractor established and that the enterprise
// package-metrics explainer depends on: it reads a symbol's FIRST `declares` target as
// the package the symbol belongs to. A Dart class already carries `declares` edges to
// its own members, so without this the explainer read the first MEMBER name as a
// package — minting one phantom package per class. Measured on drift: 1,746 "packages"
// against 199 real modules, which is the same failure the exported-surface explainer
// documents for .NET (`MediaBrowser.Controller/*` collapsing into a phantom
// `MediaBrowser`).
//
// Prepended rather than appended so the module edge reads first, matching the shape
// the Go extractor emits. It is no longer load-bearing: the explainer now resolves a
// symbol's declaring module against the known module set rather than taking the first
// `declares` target, so a member edge arriving first can no longer be mistaken for a
// package. Verified by emitting this edge LAST and confirming the metrics are
// unchanged. The member edges are kept either way: they are what makes a type's own
// surface walkable without relying on the graph's synthesized has_method.

// constant lives in another file, so this can only be done once every file has been
// walked.
//
// A reference that does not resolve takes its route WITH it. That is the deliberate
// half: the fact's Name is the route path, so an unresolved one would put a node named
// `WorkspaceStartScreen.routeName` into the graph — a path no app navigates to, which
