package engine_test

// End-to-end golden + determinism tests for the full extraction pipeline.
//
// Unlike the per-extractor unit tests (which feed inline snippets to a single
// extractor), these run the real engine wired exactly as production wires it
// (via bootstrap.NewEngine: all 9 extractors, 9 explainers, the llm_context
// renderer) over small fixture repos under testdata/repos, then assert the
// emitted fact graph byte-for-byte against a committed golden file.
//
// This is the regression net for Enola's core promise — "deterministic,
// structurally faithful extraction." A golden mismatch means the fact graph
// for a known repo changed; a reviewer diffs the regenerated JSONL to decide
// whether the change is intended. Regenerate with:
//
//	go test ./internal/engine -run TestGolden -update
//
// The golden captures only the fact graph (Store.WriteJSONL, which sorts facts
// and their relations deterministically). Snapshot metadata (timestamps,
// durations, file hashes, absolute repo path) is intentionally excluded so the
// golden is stable across machines and runs.

	// TypeScript ORMs: a TypeORM @Entity class, a Drizzle pgTable const, and Prisma
	// models in schema.prisma (read off-glob). Pins GAP-XL-04's TS half (v112) —
	// tsextractor emitted ZERO storage facts, so a database-backed Node service
	// modelled no tables at all. Also pins the io_direct seeding: repo.ts wraps an ORM

	// .hbs + .js component pair invoking a component and a helper, a template-only
	// .hbs, a route template owned by its route class and using a modifier, a
	// Router.map with nested paths, ember-data models with a belongsTo/hasMany
	// relationship edge, and a service. Pins v148 end-to-end: template blanking
	// preserves line numbers, strict-mode template refs resolve through imports and
	// locals, and the ember-resolver binder joins .hbs invocations, @service
	// injections and model relationships to the symbols the files actually declare.

	// majority-Scala repos holding hundreds of .java files). Also pins v181's two
	// measured decisions, and pins them by ABSENCE and PRESENCE respectively:
	// app/src/test/scala/.../ServiceSpec.scala contributes no symbols and no module
	// (the sbt test source set is excluded) while still carrying its references as a
	// test_ref, whereas core/src/main/scala/com/example/core/test/
	// Fixtures.scala IS extracted — production code under a directory merely named

	// lib/models/user.freezed.dart yields nothing at all (generated code is the

	// declares no imports of its own yet is still walked with user.dart's — a `part`
	// shares its host library's import scope, which every framework gate depends on.
	// The three GoRoute shapes are all present: a literal path, one declared as
	// `SettingsScreen.routeName` and resolved repo-wide, and a nested relative path
	// composed onto its parent. Every navigation route carries type "page", so
	// routeindex.IsUIRoute keeps a screen out of the cross-repo server index.
	// `class TodoItems extends Table` is a drift table ONLY because the file imports
	// drift — Table is also a Flutter layout widget.
	{name: "dart_sample", subRepos: []string{"."}},
	// The cross-repo half: a Flutter client's http call sites resolving against a Go

	// [Route("[controller]")] from a base class in ANOTHER file and resolves the

	// makes a template absolute, and — by their ABSENCE from the golden —

	{name: "go_httpclient_multirepo", subRepos: []string{"api", "consumer"}},
	// Two Go services coupled ONLY by Kafka topics — no import, no call, no HTTP

	// unit tests cannot: the topic name the extractor emits has to resolve against
	// the repo label the ENGINE assigns (the directory basename). Covers all four
	// outcomes — a consumed topic owned by a loaded repo draws the edge (including

	// alone), an own topic and an unowned topic draw nothing, and an in-process event

	// A FastAPI backend with its own frontend, beside an API-compatible rewrite

	// resolve to their mounted path ("/api/v1/search/results", not "/results"),
	// (b) the frontend's calls bind to the backend IN ITS OWN REPO rather than to
	// the rewrite that serves the same shapes, and (c) acme-rs importing
	// "@acme/native-darwin-arm64" — a package under the scope it publishes itself —
	// draws no import edge to the repo labeled "acme". Both cross-repo edges here
	// are false positives the linker used to emit; the golden pins their absence.

	// A Spring backend plus a Java consumer calling it through BOTH hand-written
	// client forms — RestTemplate (source="java-http-client") and @FeignClient
	// (source="feign"). Pins the contract-vocabulary fix that no unit test could:
	// the cross-repo linker kept its own private copy of the hand-written client
	// source set and had never included either Java value, so every Java call site
	// linked as via="http" — indistinguishable from an edge merely implied by an
	// OpenAPI spec. The golden now pins via=["http-client"] end to end, through the
	// real extractor rather than synthetic facts. java_sample cannot cover this:
	// it is single-repo, and a single-repo snapshot draws no cross-repo edge at
	// all, which is exactly why the omission survived undetected.
	{name: "java_httpclient_multirepo", subRepos: []string{"inventory", "storefront"}},
	// A decorator-routed TypeScript backend plus an SDK that calls it. Pins v142 end
	// to end, which the unit tests cannot: the server routes the @Controller classes
	// compose to have to RESOLVE against the SDK's client calls and draw a cross-repo
	// edge. Before v142 TypeScript had no server-side route DSL at all, so the api
	// repo emitted zero routes and was classified `isolated` while every SDK call sat
	// unresolved. Covers both argument forms (@Controller({path}) and
	// @Controller("…")), a bare @Get() serving the class path, the InversifyJS
	// vocabulary, and — by its absence from the golden — a verb decorator on a
	// non-controller class minting nothing.
	{name: "ts_nest_multirepo", subRepos: []string{"api", "sdk"}},
	// A call-routed Express server plus a consumer that calls it. Pins v143's three
	// rules, none of which a unit test can prove end to end: (a) receiver binding
	// separates registrations from v141's identically-shaped client calls, so no call
	// site is emitted twice and no client route is reclassified; (b) a sub-router
	// mounted in the SAME file composes ('/admin/users'), while one mounted from
	// another file emits nothing rather than a wrong fragment path ('/login'); and
	// (c) a bare catch-all is not an endpoint. The consumer's fourth call is served by
	// nobody, so it stays unresolved — the control that the linker is matching real
	// paths rather than accepting anything.
