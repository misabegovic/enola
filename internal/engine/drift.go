// Drift reports how a repository's files have moved since its snapshot was taken:
// which were added, removed, or edited. It is the answer to "does the graph I am
// about to diff still describe the code on disk?".
//
// It is deliberately a FILESYSTEM comparison, not a VCS one. The snapshot already
// records a content hash per walked file (facts.SnapshotMeta.FileHashes), so the
// question can be answered exactly, from enola's own data, for repos that are not
// git working trees at all. The git-derived signals cannot answer it: a commit that
// has not moved says nothing about the working tree, and Git.Dirty is a single
// boolean, so a tree that was ALREADY modified when the snapshot ran cannot be
// distinguished from the same tree modified further (see internal/engine/freshness.go
// and the freshness dossier's GAP-FR-03).
//
// Unknown means the comparison could not be made — the snapshot recorded no file
// hashes, which is the case for a pre-receipt snapshot or a restore whose
// snapshot.meta.json failed to load. Callers must surface that as "cannot verify"
// and never as a clean tree: silence and confirmation are different answers.

// stages of a snapshot. That is why it is an on-demand call for the tools that are
// ABOUT to make a claim about the change — diff_snapshot, and anything else computing
// its own delta — rather than part of the per-tool-call freshness banner: the banner is
// a cheap proactive nudge, this is an exact answer at a decision point. See
