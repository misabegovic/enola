// registrations must not be reported as outbound calls, and these must not be
// reported as routes served here.
//
// Note the deliberate absence of a worked example in this comment. The client
// patterns scan raw source with no comment awareness, so spelling one out here would
// mint a phantom route — latent on the corpus (zero occurrences), but real.
